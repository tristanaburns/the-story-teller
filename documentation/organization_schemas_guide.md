# The Shadow Team Chronicles: Organization Schemas Guide

This guide explains how to effectively use the organization schema system in The Shadow Team Chronicles universe to create consistent, richly detailed organizations with complex internal structures and external relationships.

## Overview of Organization Schema Architecture

The organization schema system uses a modular approach with multiple specialized schemas that can be combined to create comprehensive organization profiles:

```
organization/
├── formation_schema.json      - Origins and founding details
├── structure_schema.json      - Internal hierarchy and organization
├── goals_schema.json          - Objectives and motivations
├── assets_schema.json         - Resources and capabilities
├── relationships_schema.json  - External connections and interactions
├── culture_schema.json        - Values, practices, and identity
├── membership_schema.json     - Member requirements and demographics
├── history_schema.json        - Timeline and significant events
├── communication_methods_schema.json - Internal and external information flow
├── notable_activities_schema.json   - Operations and signature actions
├── influence_spheres_schema.json    - Areas of power and control
└── resource_management_schema.json  - Resource acquisition and allocation
```

These schemas reference standardized enums from common schemas:

- `common/organization_type_schema.json` - Standard organization categories
- `common/leadership_structure_schema.json` - Leadership models
- `common/organization_relationship_type_schema.json` - Inter-organization connections
- `common/funding_source_schema.json` - Financial resource origins
- `common/organization_purpose_schema.json` - Primary organizational motivations
- `common/cultural_value_schema.json` - Core values and principles
- `common/membership_requirement_schema.json` - Entry conditions
- `common/communication_method_schema.json` - Information exchange approaches
- `common/organizational_activity_schema.json` - Types of operations
- `common/influence_sphere_schema.json` - Domains of power
- `common/resource_type_schema.json` - Categories of organizational resources

## Key Schema Components

### 1. Organization Formation

This schema captures the founding story of an organization:

```json
{
  "founding_date": {
    "year": 2065,
    "precision": "exact",
    "calendar": "standard"
  },
  "founders": [
    {
      "entity_reference": {
        "id": "9a7b5c3d-1e2f-8g9h-4i5j-6k7l8m9n0o1p",
        "name": "Elena Volkov",
        "object_type": "character"
      },
      "role": "Primary founder and visionary",
      "motivation": "To create a secure haven for technological innovation free from corporate control"
    }
  ],
  "founding_circumstances": "Established during the aftermath of the New Shanghai Tech Riots when independent researchers were being systematically absorbed by megacorps.",
  "original_purpose": "To provide independent researchers with resources, protection, and community while maintaining their intellectual freedom."
}
```

### 2. Organization Structure

This schema defines how an organization is ordered internally:

```json
{
  "leadership_type": "council_based",
  "leaders": [
    {
      "entity_reference": {
        "id": "9a7b5c3d-1e2f-8g9h-4i5j-6k7l8m9n0o1p",
        "name": "Elena Volkov",
        "object_type": "character"
      },
      "title": "Director of Operations",
      "responsibilities": "Oversees day-to-day functions and resource allocation",
      "authority_level": "high"
    }
  ],
  "divisions": [
    {
      "name": "Research Division",
      "purpose": "Conducts primary research and development of new technologies",
      "size": "42 full-time researchers, 15 support staff",

      "level_name": "Directorate",
      "rank_titles": ["Director", "Deputy Director"],
      "authority_scope": "Strategic decision-making and division oversight"
    }
  ]
}
```

### 3. Organization Goals

This schema captures what drives an organization:

```json
{
  "primary_purpose": "technological_advancement",
  "mission_statement": "To accelerate human potential through ethical technological innovation free from corporate or governmental constraints.",
  "public_objectives": [
    {
      "objective": "Develop accessible augmentation technology for medical applications",
      "rationale": "To improve quality of life for those with disabilities or injuries",
      "progress": "advanced"
    }
  ],

    {
      "objective": "Create an independent digital infrastructure immune to corporate surveillance",
      "true_rationale": "To establish a communication network that cannot be monitored or controlled by megacorps",
      "cover_story": "Research into network efficiency and reliability improvements"
    }
  ]
}
```

### 4. Organization Relationships

This schema maps how an organization connects with other entities:

```json
{
  "organizational_relationships": [
    {
      "entity_reference": {
        "id": "1a2b3c4d-5e6f-7g8h-9i0j-1k2l3m4n5o6p",

      "description": "Appears to work for the organization but actually reports to NexusCorp, though beginning to question his loyalties.",
      "status": "active",
      "public_knowledge": false
    }
  ]
}
```

## Implementation Guidelines

### Building a Basic Organization

When creating a new organization, start with these essential components:

1. **Core Identity**: Define the organization_type, leadership_structure, and primary_purpose
2. **Origin Story**: Establish founding_date, founders, and original_purpose
3. **Current Status**: Specify current leaders, headquarters location, size, and resources

Example of a minimal viable organization:

```json
{
  "metadata": {
    "object_type": "organization",
    "version": "1.0.0",
    "tags": ["resistance", "cyberpunk", "hacker", "neo-tokyo"]
  },
  "name": "The Circuit Breakers",
  "organization_type": "resistance_group",
  "formation": {
    "founding_date": {
      "year": 2075,
      "precision": "year",
      "calendar": "standard"
    },
    "founding_circumstances": "Formed after the Digital Rights Massacre of 2074",
    "original_purpose": "To fight against corporate control of the datasphere"
  },
  "structure": {
    "leadership_type": "cellular",
    "leaders": [
      {
        "entity_reference": {
          "id": "9a7b5c3d-1e2f-8g9h-4i5j-6k7l8m9n0o1p",
          "name": "Cipher",
          "object_type": "character"
        },
        "title": "Coordinator",
        "authority_level": "moderate"
      }
    ]
  },
  "goals": {
    "primary_purpose": "social_change",
    "mission_statement": "Free the data. Free the people."
  }
}
```

### Creating Complex Organizations

For more sophisticated organizations, implement these additional schemas:

1. **Internal Dynamics**:
   - Add divisions with distinct purposes
   - Define hierarchical structure
   - Establish cultural values and membership requirements

2. **External Position**:
   - Map relationships with other organizations
   - Define influence spheres
   - Document notable activities

Example of advanced organization relationships:

```json
{
  "organizational_relationships": [
    {
      "entity_reference": {
        "id": "1a2b3c4d-5e6f-7g8h-9i0j-1k2l3m4n5o6p",
        "name": "DataSec Corporation",
        "object_type": "organization"
      },
      "relationship_type": "hostile",
      "description": "Primary corporate target of the Circuit Breakers' operations",
      "public_knowledge": true,
      "stability": "intense",
      "key_points_of_contact": [
        {
          "id": "7a8b9c0d-1e2f-3g4h-5i6j-7k8l9m0n1o2p",
          "name": "Shadow",
          "object_type": "character"
        }
      ],
      "areas_of_conflict": ["data control", "surveillance systems", "neural implant regulation"]
    },
    {
      "entity_reference": {
        "id": "2a3b4c5d-6e7f-8g9h-0i1j-2k3l4m5n6o7p",
        "name": "Free Net Alliance",
        "object_type": "organization"
      },
      "relationship_type": "alliance",
      "description": "Cooperative relationship sharing resources and intelligence",
      "public_knowledge": false,
      "stability": "strong"
    }
  ]
}
```

### Schema Extensions for Special Organization Types

Different organization types benefit from focusing on specific schemas:

#### Corporations and Megacorps
- Emphasize `assets_schema.json` with detailed financial resources
- Develop complex divisional structure in `structure_schema.json`
- Use `influence_spheres_schema.json` to show market and political control

#### Criminal Organizations
- Focus on `secrecy` in `communication_methods_schema.json`
- Detail `covert_influence` in `influence_spheres_schema.json`
- Emphasize `secret_objectives` in `goals_schema.json`

#### Government Bodies
- Highlight `legal_authority` in `assets_schema.json`
- Detail territorial divisions in `structure_schema.json`
- Map extensive relationships with other governmental and non-governmental entities

#### Resistance Groups
- Detail cellular structure and security measures
- Emphasize ideological framework in `goals_schema.json`
- Focus on clandestine operations in `notable_activities_schema.json`

## Recommended Schema Combinations

Based on organization type, prioritize these schema combinations:

| Organization Type | Primary Schemas | Secondary Schemas |
|-------------------|----------------|------------------|
| Corporation | structure, assets, influence_spheres | goals, relationships, resource_management |
| Government | structure, influence_spheres, relationships | formation, history, communication_methods |
| Criminal | goals, communication_methods, notable_activities | relationships, membership, culture |
| Military | structure, assets, notable_activities | formation, culture, resource_management |
| Resistance | goals, membership, communication_methods | relationships, notable_activities, culture |
| Religious | culture, goals, history | formation, membership, influence_spheres |

## Common Schema Values and Usage Examples

### Organization Types

Use standardized types from `organization_type_schema.json`:

```json
"organization_type": "megacorp"  // For massive, government-influencing corporations
"organization_type": "criminal_syndicate"  // For organized crime groups
"organization_type": "resistance_group"  // For anti-establishment organizations
"organization_type": "intelligence_agency"  // For spy organizations
```

### Leadership Structures

Use standardized structures from `leadership_structure_schema.json`:

```json
"leadership_type": "hierarchical"  // Traditional top-down structure with clear chain of command
"leadership_type": "council_based"  // Leadership by committee or governing body
"leadership_type": "cellular"  // Decentralized structure with semi-autonomous units
"leadership_type": "ai_directed"  // Primary leadership decisions made by artificial intelligence
```

### Cultural Values

Use standardized values from `cultural_value_schema.json`:

```json
"core_values": [
  {
    "value": "secrecy",
    "priority": "primary",
    "expression": "Compartmentalized information and need-to-know protocols"
  },
  {
    "value": "loyalty",
    "priority": "primary",
    "expression": "Extreme vetting and regular loyalty tests for members"
  }
]
```

## Advanced Techniques

### 1. Modeling Internal Conflict

Create realistic tensions within organizations:

```json
"factional_divisions": [
  {
    "faction_name": "Traditionalists",
    "leadership": [
      {
        "id": "1a2b3c4d-5e6f-7g8h-9i0j-1k2l3m4n5o6p",
        "name": "Admiral Yao",
        "object_type": "character"
      }
    ],
    "ideology": "Maintain strict hierarchy and conventional military doctrine",
    "relative_strength": "declining",
    "relationships_with_other_factions": [
      {
        "faction_name": "Reformists",
        "relationship": "hostile"
      }
    ]
  },
  {
    "faction_name": "Reformists",
    "leadership": [
      {
        "id": "2a3b4c5d-6e7f-8g9h-0i1j-2k3l4m5n6o7p",
        "name": "Commander Lin",
        "object_type": "character"
      }
    ],
    "ideology": "Adopt new technologies and unconventional tactics",
    "relative_strength": "growing"
  }
]
```

### 2. Evolution Over Time

Document how organizations change:

```json
"evolution_of_goals": [
  {
    "previous_goal": "Provide underground medical care to augmentation accident victims",
    "current_adaptation": "Develop and distribute safer augmentation technology",
    "reason_for_change": "Realized treatment alone was insufficient to address the root problem",
    "date_of_shift": {
      "year": 2078,
      "precision": "year"
    }
  }
]
```

### 3. Layered Communication Security

Create realistic secure communication systems:

```json
"internal_communications": [
  {
    "method": "encrypted_messaging",
    "description": "Triple-layered encrypted text and voice communications",
    "purpose": "Day-to-day operational communications",
    "authorized_users": "All verified members",
    "security_level": "high"
  },
  {
    "method": "dead_drops",
    "description": "Physical information exchange at predetermined locations",
    "purpose": "Transfer of highly sensitive information that cannot risk digital interception",
    "authorized_users": "Cell leaders and above",
    "security_level": "maximum"
  }
]
```

## Best Practices

1. **Maintain Consistency**: Ensure organization details align with established world lore.

2. **Create Realistic Contradictions**: Organizations often say one thing publicly while doing another.

3. **Connect to Characters**: Link to existing character IDs for leadership and key members.

4. **Balance Power**: Consider how multiple organizations interact and check each other's influence.

5. **Consider Resources and Scale**: Ensure an organization's capabilities match its resource base and size.

6. **Document History**: Create a sense of depth by including founding details and evolution over time.

7. **Diversify Communication**: Different types of information should flow through different channels.

8. **Include Internal Tensions**: Few large organizations are monolithic; include internal factions or conflicts.

      "stability": "deteriorating",
      "formality_level": "unspoken"
    }
  ]
}
```
