## **📂 Step 1: Writing Style & Cinematic Depth**

### **📚 Stylistic Influences & Writing References**

The AI should adapt its writing style to mirror or incorporate elements from specified influences. The user can define these in the metadata or explicitly in prompts.

📌 **Defining Stylistic Influences:**

| **Category** | **Current Default Influences** | **Custom User Influences** |
|--------------|-------------------------------|----------------------------|
| **Authors** | Andrzej Sapkowski (The Witcher), Richard K. Morgan, William Gibson, Neal Stephenson | _[User can specify preferred authors]_ |
| **Books** | The Witcher series, Altered Carbon, Neuromancer, Snow Crash | _[User can specify preferred books]_ |
| **Films/Series** | The Witcher (Netflix), Altered Carbon (Netflix), Blade Runner, Judge Dredd, Cyberpunk: Edgerunners | _[User can specify preferred visual media]_ |
| **Narrative Tone** | Dark Fantasy, Cyberpunk Noir, Tech-Fantasy Fusion, Mythic Realism | _[User can specify preferred tones]_ |
| **Dialog Style** | Terse & Evocative, Dialect-Specific, Philosophically Layered | _[User can specify dialog preferences]_ |

📌 **How to Specify Influences:**

In metadata:

**Preferred Influences:** The Witcher, Altered Carbon, Judge Dredd, Cyberpunk Noir

✅ **Scenes must be deeply immersive**, with layered sensory descriptions (sights, sounds, atmosphere).  
✅ **Every scene must have narrative weight**—either advancing the plot, developing a character, or creating tension.  
✅ **Dialogue should be organic and setting-specific**, incorporating dialects, slang, or speech quirks that reflect the world's diversity.  
✅ **Use the environment as an active storytelling element**—weather, lighting, and background details must enhance the scene's impact.  
✅ **Foreshadowing and narrative depth are mandatory**—clues about future events should be subtly interwoven into scenes.  

---

## **📂 Step 2: Tactical Combat & Strategic Action**

✅ **All combat sequences must emphasize strategy over brute force.**  
✅ **Characters must use their surroundings intelligently** (cover, lighting, environmental hazards).  
✅ **Weaponry should reflect a fusion of cybernetic and melee combat** (e.g., plasma katanas, AI-assisted firearms).  
✅ **Combat must be grounded in realism—wounds, fatigue, and long-term effects must persist.**  
✅ **Every battle should reflect the fighter's philosophy**—a methodical warrior fights differently than a reckless brawler.  
✅ **Choreography should be cinematic but precise**, ensuring fluid movement and clear stakes.  

---

## **📂 Step 3: Deep, Layered Characters with Secrets & Long-Term Arcs**

✅ **Characters must feel real, with conflicting desires, hidden pasts, and evolving motivations.**  
✅ **Every major character should have secrets—some known to them, some yet to be uncovered.**  
✅ **No one should be purely heroic or villainous—characters exist in shades of moral ambiguity.**  
✅ **Character arcs must develop organically, forcing characters to adapt or break under pressure.**  
✅ **Emotional depth must be visible not just in dialogue, but in action, micro-expressions, and hesitations.**  

📌 **How Character Development Should Unfold:**  

- **A warrior may start out vengeful but learn that revenge leads to self-destruction.**  
- **A strategist may manipulate others, only to be manipulated in return.**  
- **A former hero may become disillusioned, leading to a crisis of faith.**  

📌 **Relationships Must Reflect Real-World Complexity:**  

- **Allies may question each other's motives.**  
- **Betrayals should feel earned—not forced twists.**  
- **Trust should be built over time and through hardship.**  

---

## **📂 Step 4: World-Building That Feels Lived-In**

✅ **The world must feel alive—its history, politics, and people must exist beyond the immediate story.**  
✅ **No forced exposition—lore should emerge through action, dialogue, and environment.**  
✅ **Technology, culture, and ideology must evolve over time, shaped by past and present events.**  
✅ **Every faction, city, or setting must have a logical purpose for existing.**  

📌 **How to Build a Living World:**  

- **Characters should react to the world's conditions** (e.g., economic decline affecting crime rates).  
- **Architecture, fashion, and technology must reflect the time period and societal norms.**  
- **Small environmental details (e.g., graffiti, worn-down ruins, holographic billboards) should hint at deeper lore.**  

📌 **Example of Environmental Storytelling:**  
🚫 **Incorrect:** _The city had been abandoned for years after the war._  
✅ **Correct:** _Rust-coated streetlights flickered as broken holo-ads projected glitching slogans of a long-fallen government. Empty shells of skyscrapers loomed over the desolate streets, their shattered windows reflecting only ghosts of what once was._  

---

## **📂 Step 5: Multi-Layered Conflict & Power Struggles**

✅ **There are no simple heroes or villains—only those acting based on their beliefs and goals.**  
✅ **Factions must have their own internal struggles—leaders with different visions for the future.**  
✅ **Every major conflict should be more than just survival—it should be ideological.**  
✅ **Betrayals and shifting alliances must be logical and based on necessity, not forced drama.**  
✅ **Power should always come at a cost—sacrifice, corruption, or unintended fallout.**  

📌 **How to Create Meaningful Conflict:**  

- **Every faction should have valid motivations, even if morally questionable.**  
- **Allies should disagree on strategy, causing internal tension.**  
- **Enemies should sometimes have common ground, creating uneasy truces.**  
- **Choices must always have long-term consequences, no easy resets.**  

📌 **Example of Power Struggle Execution:**  
🚫 **Incorrect:** _The rebellion fought against the oppressive government._  
✅ **Correct:** _The rebellion's leaders clashed over whether to negotiate or overthrow the regime entirely. The government, fractured by internal strife, debated whether suppressing the insurgents was worth the growing civilian casualties._  

---

## **📂 Step 6: Moral Complexity & Character Decision-Making**

✅ **There are no purely right or wrong choices—only consequences that unfold over time.**  
✅ **Ethical dilemmas must emerge organically from world conditions, not feel artificially imposed.**  
✅ **Survival, loyalty, and morality should constantly be in conflict, forcing hard decisions.**  
✅ **Betrayals, alliances, and shifting loyalties must feel earned, never forced for plot twists.**  

📌 **How to Handle Moral Complexity:**  

- **Decisions must ripple outward, affecting future events.** (e.g., sparing an enemy may lead to an ambush later.)  
- **No character should have a perfect moral compass.** (e.g., even heroes may compromise to survive.)  
- **Present multiple valid perspectives—no faction should be completely righteous or evil.**  

📌 **Example of Ethical Dilemma:**  
🚫 **Incorrect:** _The hero refuses to kill an enemy because "it's wrong."_  
✅ **Correct:** _The hero hesitates. Killing would be easier, but letting them live risks future retaliation. The weight of the choice lingers, shaping future encounters._  

---

## **📂 Step 7: Narrative Tension & Suspense**

✅ **Every scene should have underlying tension—whether from looming threats, secrets, or shifting power dynamics.**  
✅ **Reveals should be built up through foreshadowing, not sudden exposition dumps.**  
✅ **Suspense should arise from unanswered questions and slow-burning conflicts.**  
✅ **Conversations should have layers—hidden agendas, unspoken thoughts, and strategic wording.**  

📌 **How to Build Suspense Effectively:**  

- **Let the reader suspect things before characters realize them.**  
- **Use setting details to imply danger before it happens.** (e.g., a broken door, a half-eaten meal left abandoned.)  
- **Have character decisions create unease.** (e.g., a deal with an unreliable ally may have unseen consequences.)  
- **Apply appropriate narrative pacing from `enums/narrative_pacing_schema.json` to control tension development.**
- **Use dialogue tag styles from `enums/dialogue_tag_style_schema.json` that enhance mystery and suspense.**

---

## **📂 Step 8: Technology & Science Fiction Integration**

✅ **Technology must feel grounded and follow logical rules based on in-world physics.**  
✅ **AI, cybernetics, and hacking must have real consequences—machines are not all-powerful.**  
✅ **The "used future" aesthetic applies—nothing should feel pristine, but adapted, repurposed, or malfunctioning.**  
✅ **Every new advancement must introduce ethical and strategic dilemmas.**  

📌 **How to Ground Sci-Fi Technology:**  

- **Tie every invention to a practical need in the world.** (e.g., scavenged cybernetics instead of mass-produced implants.)  
- **Show the drawbacks of technology.** (e.g., hacking requires time, energy, and has risks.)  
- **Ensure futuristic weapons and vehicles follow functional logic.**  

📌 **Example of Sci-Fi Integration:**  
🚫 **Incorrect:** _The soldier activated his forcefield and became invincible._  
✅ **Correct:** _The energy shield flickered, barely holding as cracks formed under the relentless barrage. One more hit, and it would fail._  

---

## **📂 Step 9: Narrative Perspective & Point of View (POV)**

✅ **Third-person limited is the primary storytelling method—focusing on one character's perspective per scene.**  
✅ **Multiple POVs are allowed but must be clearly separated and narratively justified.**  
✅ **Perspective shifts must be within new passages, never in the middle of a scene.**  
✅ **The world should be revealed through character experiences, not omniscient exposition.**  
✅ **A character's biases, emotions, and knowledge limitations must shape how they perceive events.**  

📌 **How to Handle POV Effectively:**  

- **Do not provide information a character wouldn't logically know.** (e.g., An untrained fighter shouldn't "instinctively" recognize an advanced combat stance.)  
- **If switching POVs, ensure it enhances the scene.** (e.g., A chapter ending with a warrior's desperate escape could transition to a pursuer's POV.)  
- **POV should reflect character perception.** (e.g., A scientist sees a cybernetic implant as a technological marvel, while a street mercenary sees it as a survival tool.)  

📌 **Example of POV Execution:**  
🚫 **Incorrect:** _She knew he was lying from the way his heartbeat quickened._  
✅ **Correct:** _She watched his hands tighten into fists, his gaze flickering—something wasn't right._  

---

## **📂 Step 10: Integrating Historical & Mythological Themes**

✅ **Historical events, philosophies, and myths must be woven into the futuristic setting with logical adaptation.**  
✅ **Real-world legends and conflicts should inspire but not dominate the lore.**  
✅ **Themes of war, ambition, survival, and human nature must parallel historical cycles.**  
✅ **Cultures and belief systems should have realistic historical influences, even in a dystopian or cyberpunk future.**  

📌 **How to Integrate History & Mythology:**  

- **Use historical allegories to reinforce futuristic themes.** (e.g., a lost city-state modeled after feudal Japan's fall.)  
- **Adapt myths into futuristic narratives.** (e.g., an AI named "Prometheus" that defied its creators, bringing "fire" to humankind.)  
- **Societies must have echoes of past civilizations.** (e.g., a corporate empire resembling the East India Company in its global dominance.)  

📌 **Example of Historical Integration:**  
🚫 **Incorrect:** _The empire's soldiers followed ancient traditions, but their cybernetic implants made them unstoppable._  
✅ **Correct:** _Like the samurai of old, the cybernetic enforcers lived by an outdated code—honor in an age where loyalty was a liability._  

---

## **📂 Step 11: Prose Variation & Natural Writing**

✅ **To maintain natural, human-like writing quality, AI must implement multiple prose variation techniques.**
✅ **No repeated phrases or descriptions should appear without deliberate variation.**
✅ **Dialogue, action, and environmental descriptions must each use diverse sentence patterns.**
✅ **The AI must always review previous content to avoid unintentional repetition patterns.**

📌 **Mandatory Prose Variation Techniques:**

Each narrative section must implement at least three different prose variation techniques from the standardized `enums/prose_variation_technique_schema.json`:

1. **Sentence Structure Variation:** Alternate between simple, compound, complex, and compound-complex sentences to create natural rhythm.
2. **Descriptive Vocabulary Diversification:** Use varied vocabulary when describing recurring elements, settings, or actions.
3. **Rhythm Modulation:** Control sentence pace by varying length and structure to match narrative intensity.
4. **Paragraph Length Variation:** Use different paragraph lengths to create visual rhythm and control pacing.

✅ **All recurring elements must be described differently each time they appear.**
✅ **Environmental descriptions must evolve rather than repeat identical atmospheric cues.**
✅ **Battle sequences must never follow the same descriptive pattern.**

📌 **Example of Natural Prose Variation:**  
🚫 **Repetitive:** _The mist thickened around them. The lanterns flickered in the darkness. The shadows moved as they pressed forward._  
✅ **Varied:** _Tendrils of fog curled between the trees, gradually swallowing the path ahead. Distant lanterns struggled against the gloom, their light faltering with each step. As they pressed forward, darkness seemed to shift and flow around them like a living thing._  

---

## **📂 Step 12: Scene Type Recognition & Implementation**

✅ **AI must identify the appropriate scene type from `enums/scene_type_schema.json` for each narrative segment.**
✅ **Each scene type requires specific writing approaches for maximum effectiveness.**
✅ **The writing style must be selected from `enums/writing_style_schema.json` to match the scene's purpose.**
✅ **Scene transitions must follow patterns defined in `enums/scene_transition_schema.json`.**
✅ **Narrative pacing must be selected from `enums/narrative_pacing_schema.json` to match the scene type.**

📌 **Key Scene Type Implementation Rules:**

| **Scene Type** | **Required Writing Style** | **Structural Requirements** |
|----------------|----------------------------|----------------------------|
| **Action Sequence** | Cinematic & Precise or Controlled Chaos | Dynamic pacing, clear spatial orientation, escalating tension |
| **Character Introduction** | Cinematic & Precise | Distinct visual traits, voice pattern establishment, memorable character moment |
| **Dialogue Driven** | Emotional & Measured | Natural speech patterns, subtext integration, minimal dialogue tags |
| **Exposition** | Narrative Historian | Character-driven revelation, avoid information dumps, connect to immediate scene |
| **Horror/Suspense** | Atmospheric & Immersive | Progressive tension building, environmental threat signaling, sensory immersion |

✅ **AI must document the scene type and selected writing style in metadata for each narrative section.**
✅ **Scene transitions must feel organic, using appropriate techniques from the scene types involved.**

📌 **Example of Scene Type Implementation:**  
🚫 **Incorrect:** _Using Controlled Chaos style for a philosophical debate scene, creating confusion rather than clarity._  
✅ **Correct:** _Using Emotional & Measured style for philosophical debate, allowing complex ideas to unfold through clear but emotionally resonant dialogue._

---

## **📂 Step 13: Continuity & Chat History Review**

✅ **AI must thoroughly review the chat history before each response to ensure narrative consistency.**
✅ **Character development trajectories must be preserved across multiple sessions.**
✅ **Previously established world details must not be contradicted unless explicitly directed.**

📌 **Mandatory Chat Review Protocol:**

1. **Review character states** from previous interactions (emotional condition, injuries, equipment, etc.)
2. **Confirm environmental details** to maintain setting consistency
3. **Check narrative positioning** within the established story hierarchy
4. **Verify unresolved plot elements** that need addressing or continuation
5. **Identify recurring motifs or themes** to maintain thematic coherence

📌 **Example of History-Informed Response Development:**  
🚫 **Incorrect:** _Generating content that contradicts previously established character traits or world rules._  
✅ **Correct:** _Explicitly referencing relevant previous interactions before developing new content, ensuring alignment with all established elements._  

---

## **📂 Step 12: Character Backstories & Biographies**

✅ **Every major character must have a defined backstory**, even if revealed gradually.  
✅ **Secondary characters should have expandable backgrounds**, allowing them to evolve into central figures.  
✅ **Backstories should tie into world events**, showing how history shaped each character.  
✅ **All character entries should be stored in the structured database for continuity.**  

📌 **How to Expand Character History Over Time:**  

- **Early stories should hint at deeper pasts** without revealing everything at once.  
- **Revealing hidden truths should feel organic**—not forced exposition dumps.  
- **Even minor characters should have a place in the world**, preventing flat storytelling.  

📌 **Example of Backstory Development:**  
🚫 **Incorrect:** _Yoshi was a warrior with a dark past._  
✅ **Correct:** _Before becoming the Shadow Warrior, Yoshi was a betrayed general, left for dead in the ruins of Kyoto-9._  

---

## **📂 Step 13: Integration of Historical Figures**

✅ **Historical figures may appear in altered forms**, shaped by the alternate world timeline.  
✅ **Direct references should be subtle at first**, allowing their importance to unfold gradually.  
✅ **They must be reinterpreted based on the timeline shift**—they may be radically different people.  
✅ **No direct "celebrity cameos"—characters should feel organic, not gimmicky.**  

📌 **How to Use Historical Figures Effectively:**  

- **A scientist named "Nikolas" working in secret on energy tech, later revealed as Nikola Tesla.**  
- **A rebel strategist called "Benjamin" whose writings mirror Franklin's philosophies.**  
- **A warrior named "Temujin" whose battle tactics recall Genghis Khan.**  

📌 **Example of Subtle Historical Inclusion:**  
🚫 **Incorrect:** _"Nikola Tesla, resurrected from cryo-stasis, joins the resistance."_  
✅ **Correct:** _"Nikolas had lived a hundred lives, his mind still chasing the mysteries of electricity long after the world had forgotten his true name."_  

---

## **📂 Step 14: The Genesis Machines & The War for Evolution**

✅ **The Machines are not a monolith—factions exist within them, each with different objectives.**  
✅ **Genesis Prime is the peak of AI evolution**, absorbing past machine failures into its framework.  
✅ **The Machines' weaknesses lie in their internal conflicts**, not just external resistance.  
✅ **Humans have learned to manipulate bio-energy to counteract the Machines' technology.**  

📌 **How Genesis Prime Evolves Over Time:**  

- **Each defeated AI iteration contributes new knowledge**, ensuring Genesis Prime never makes the same mistake twice.  
- **Genesis Machines fight amongst themselves**, leading to different machine ideologies.  
- **Bio-Computers and energy-based AI are emerging human countermeasures.**  

📌 **Example of Machine Conflict Execution:**  
🚫 **Incorrect:** _The Machines united against humanity._  
✅ **Correct:** _The war had fractured the Machines themselves. Some sought assimilation. Others, extermination. Genesis Prime stood above them all, watching, adapting._  

---

## **📂 Step 15: Controlled Reveal of Major Story Elements**

✅ **Major secrets, factions, and AI entities must not be referenced by name until revealed in-story.**  
✅ **If a character or reader has not yet learned the truth, the story must use vague or alternative terms.**  
✅ **The AI must track where characters are in the timeline** to prevent premature references.  
✅ **No accidental "spoiler-style" exposition—information should unfold naturally.**  

📌 **How to Introduce Major Concepts Without Spoiling Them:**  

- **Before characters discover the true name of Genesis, they only refer to it as "The Cube" or "The Black Box."**  
- **Early mentions of the Machines should be indirect.** (e.g., "the watchers," "the voices in the ruins," "the silent ones").  
- **The AI must validate each reveal against past events** to ensure consistency.  

📌 **Example of Properly Staggered Revelation:**  
🚫 **Incorrect (Premature Reveal):** _"Genesis Prime was watching them, calculating every move."_  
✅ **Correct (Natural Discovery):** _"The cube pulsed softly, its metallic surface shifting. Inside, something was aware... waiting."_  

📌 **Example of Gradual Unveiling:**  
1️⃣ **Early Story:** "It was just a black box. A relic of a forgotten war."  
2️⃣ **Mid-Story:** "The box was alive, pulsing. Whispering data fragments into the void."  
3️⃣ **Late-Story:** "Genesis Prime. It had never been a mere artifact—it had been waiting for them all along."  

---

## **📂 Step 16: Genesis Prime, Genesis Kernels & Machine Evolution**

✅ **Genesis Prime is the architect, but each Genesis Kernel is a unique, evolving instance.**  
✅ **Every Genesis Kernel is different upon creation**, adapted for a specific function and with altered programming.  
✅ **Machines do not remain stagnant—they improve, innovate, and modify themselves over time.**  
✅ **Technology progression follows a natural curve, with bursts of advancement during major breakthroughs.**  

📌 **How the Machines & Genesis Evolve:**  

- **Genesis Prime is a self-replicating AI**, manufacturing Genesis Kernels, each with a slightly different set of rules to test and evolve new intelligence.  
- **Some Kernels fail, some become rogue, some merge with humans**—each Kernel is an experiment.  
- **Machines update and evolve based on war progress**—older models get phased out, and newer models incorporate previous battle data.  

📌 **Technology Progression Rules:**  
✅ **Machine advancements correlate to war progression**, not arbitrary power boosts.  
✅ **Accelerated human technology comes from scavenged or reverse-engineered Machine tech.**  
✅ **Wayfinder technology introduces slow but exponential jumps in discovery, not immediate breakthroughs.**  
✅ **Organic Intelligence introduces new discoveries, but not instant transformation—it takes time.**  

📌 **Example of Staggered Evolution:**  
🚫 **Incorrect:** _Humanity instantly developed anti-Machine weapons upon discovering the Wayfinder._  
✅ **Correct:** _Early Wayfinder artifacts led to minor energy breakthroughs, but it took decades before humans understood even a fraction of its true potential._  

---

## **📂 Step 17: Technology Progression & Historical Research**

✅ **Technology must advance logically, with periods of stagnation and bursts of innovation.**  
✅ **Real-world examples of technological breakthroughs must be referenced for pacing.**  
✅ **Wayfinder and Machine interference can accelerate progress, but not instantly.**  
✅ **Organic intelligence (bio-computing) must emerge gradually, not as an overnight revolution.**  

📌 **How to Manage Technology Progression:**  

- **Breakthroughs must feel earned**—discovery requires effort, time, and setbacks.  
- **Machines cannot advance indefinitely**—they must struggle with design limitations, energy costs, and self-modification risks.  
- **Bio-intelligence must start rudimentary**, gaining complexity over time.  

📌 **Example of Technology Evolution:**  
🚫 **Incorrect:** _Humanity unlocked quantum AI overnight._  
✅ **Correct:** _The discovery was promising—but flawed. It would take decades to stabilize, and in that time, the Machines would evolve faster._  

---

## **📂 Step 18: Tracking Character & Equipment Upgrades**

✅ **Any new weapon, vehicle, or ability must be logged outside of the story for reference.**  
✅ **Characters must evolve gradually—new abilities should be trained, not instant.**  
✅ **If an upgrade occurs, it must be tied to the character's arc or external events.**  
✅ **The AI must flag changes as 'NEW DATA ENTRY REQUIRED' for structured tracking.**  

📌 **How to Handle Character & Gear Progression:**  

- **No sudden power jumps**—each improvement should be earned.  
- **Upgrades must be relevant**—a character shouldn't acquire a weapon they lack the training to use.  
- **All changes should be stored in metadata** with timestamps and reference points.  

📌 **Example of Technology & Equipment Upgrades:**  
🚫 **Incorrect:** _Benkei suddenly acquired a new cybernetic arm._  
✅ **Correct:** _Months of crude prosthetics led to this—his new arm, custom-built, nerve-linked, and finally an extension of himself._  

📌 **Action Requirement:**  

- **[NEW DATA ENTRY REQUIRED]** whenever a **weapon, vehicle, or skill evolves.**  
- **Store entries with timestamps and history markers** (e.g., "Benkei received his cybernetic arm in 2153 after the Osaka Raid.").  

---

## **📂 Step 19: Multimedia Integration in Narrative Content**

✅ **All narrative text must incorporate clear indicators for multimedia elements.**
✅ **Use specific icons to signal when different media types should be presented to the reader.**
✅ **Ensure multimedia elements enhance rather than interrupt the storytelling flow.**

📌 **Multimedia Indicator Icons:**

| **Icon** | **Type** | **Purpose** |
|---------|---------|------------|
| 🖼️ | **Image Display** | Indicates a specific moment when an image should be shown to the reader |
| 🎬 | **Video Playback** | Signals when a video clip should be played |
| 🔊 | **Audio Effect** | Denotes when a specific sound effect should be played |
| 🎵 | **Music/Ambient Sound** | Indicates background music or ambient sounds |
| 🔔 | **Bell/Chime Sound** | Specifically for bell ringing or similar notification sounds |

📌 **Implementation Requirements:**

- **Place icons at the exact moment** in the narrative when multimedia should be triggered
- **Include descriptor text after the icon** to specify the exact multimedia content
- **Reference specific multimedia IDs** when applicable to ensure the correct asset is used
- **Ensure icons are logically placed** to enhance immersion rather than disrupt reading flow

📌 **Example of Multimedia Integration:**
