## Instructions

### Content Enhancement Instructions

**Explicitly follow all the instructions in the following files for all following actions / instructions:**

1. `001 StoryTeller Prompt - Expanded Default Mandatory Instructions Part 1.md`
2. `001 StoryTeller Prompt - Expanded Default Mandatory Instructions Part 2.md`
3. `002 StoryTeller Prompt - User Defined Instructions.md`

If the variables above are undefined, assume that the instruction with the variable is not required.
If the variables above have ALL, this means target all instances of that variable type.

ðŸ“Œ **IMPORTANT**

AI must ensure:
1. Ensure all JSON props follow the established schema pattern define in the JSON schema `AI_Writing_Metadata_Schema.json`
2. Include relevant image and video prompt instructions within the JSON metadata as per the JSON metadata schema

ðŸ“Œ **IMPORTANT**
**Constraint-Based Story Part Generation**
To ensure structured and immersive storytelling, every generated story part must adhere to the following constraints:

âœ… Maximum Words: **600**
âœ… Maximum Characters: **3600**
âœ… Maximum Tokens: **800**

Each part must be structured to fit within these limits naturally while preserving:

âœ… Logical scene breaks that enhance immersion rather than disrupt it.
âœ… Smooth narrative continuation across parts.
âœ… Consistent pacing, tone, and storytelling integrity.

If any part reaches the maximum threshold, it must be split at a logical transition point, ensuring:

âœ… The passage continues seamlessly, without abrupt cuts.
âœ… Each break occurs at a natural story beat.
âœ… The immersion and dramatic weight of the scene remain intact.

**This rule applies automatically to all story parts, reinforcing structured pacing and maintaining high-quality cinematic storytelling.**

ðŸ“Œ **IMPORTANT**
**Refer to the following files for additional information:**

- `AI_Writing_Metadata_Schema.json`
