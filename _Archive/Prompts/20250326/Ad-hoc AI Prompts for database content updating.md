   - Verify reference integrity (all UUIDs properly connecting between databases)
   - Resolve any conflicts or contradictions with existing database entries
   - When updating references, maintain the hierarchical relationships defined in relationship_types.json
   - Check for reference loops that might create circular dependencies

   - Document ambiguous references with confidence scores and reasoning
   - Flag references with potential future narrative implications
   - Track reference evolution through narrative progression
   - Create consistency maps for complex reference networks

4. **Schema Compliance**

   - Map events to their narrative appearances in storyline_references
   - Update temporal relationships between events, causes, and effects
   - Follow the modular approach described in `timeline_schemas_guide.md`
   - Resolve any timeline paradoxes or contradictions that may arise
   - Maintain proper chronological ordering using ISO-8601 date formats
   - For events with uncertain dates, use the approximate_date format specified in the schema
