## Instructions

### Content Enhancement Instructions

## ðŸ“Œ **IMPORTANT - DATABASE STRUCTURE AND REFERENCES**
**Refer to the baseline documentation for all database structures and schemas:**

- `README.md` (located at the root of the project directory)
- `/documentation/readme.md` (for specific database update procedures)
- `/CONTENT/The Shadow Team Chronicles/DATABASE/*.json` (the actual databases are located here)

These documentation files contain comprehensive information about:
- All JSON database files which store the canonical story universe information
- The purpose and structure of each database (character_database.json, location_database.json, event_database.json, etc.)
- How these databases cross-reference each other to maintain narrative consistency
- Schema definitions and validation guidelines for each database type
- Proper procedures for updating and extending the story universe
- Character, location, event, and timeline reference systems
- How to format and add new content while maintaining database integrity
- Cross-referencing patterns between database files

The JSON database files form the foundational knowledge base of the entire story universe. Any content created or modified must align with the information stored in these databases to maintain narrative consistency. Always consult these documentation files before adding content that references characters, locations, events, artifacts, or other established story elements.

ðŸ“Œ **IMPORTANT**

AI must ensure:
1. Ensure all JSON props follow the established schema pattern define in the JSON schema `AI_Writing_Metadata_Schema.md`
2. Include relevant image and video prompt instructions within the JSON metadata as per the JSON metadata schema

ðŸ“Œ **IMPORTANT**
**Constraint-Based Story Part Generation**
To ensure structured and immersive storytelling, every generated story part must adhere to the following constraints:

âœ… Maximum Words: **600**
âœ… Maximum Characters: **3600**
âœ… Maximum Tokens: **800**

Each part must be structured to fit within these limits naturally while preserving:

âœ… Logical scene breaks that enhance immersion rather than disrupt it.
âœ… Smooth narrative continuation across parts.
âœ… Consistent pacing, tone, and storytelling integrity.

If any part reaches the maximum threshold, it must be split at a logical transition point, ensuring:

âœ… The passage continues seamlessly, without abrupt cuts.
âœ… Each break occurs at a natural story beat.
âœ… The immersion and dramatic weight of the scene remain intact.

**This rule applies automatically to all story parts, reinforcing structured pacing and maintaining high-quality cinematic storytelling.**

ðŸ“Œ **IMPORTANT**
**Refer to the following files for additional information:**

- `AI_Writing_Metadata_Schema.json`
- `character_database.json`
- `timeline_database.json`

**DO NOT DIRECTLY UPDATE THE FILE, JUST PRINT THE RESULT TO THE CHAT**

1. Read the entire target content first to understand context, tone, and narrative structure.

2. Review and apply these enhancement techniques:
   - Implement prose variation techniques from `prose_variation_technique_schema.json`

   - Ensure narrative structure follows hierarchy in `narrative_structure_schema.json`
   - Maintain consistency with previous narrative elements

3. Common enhancement requests:
   ```
   /enhance prose
   Apply at least 3 prose variation techniques to make the writing more natural and dynamic.
   
   /adjust writing style <style_name>
   Change the prose to match the specified writing style (e.g., cinematic_precise, atmospheric_immersive).
   
   /improve scene <scene_type>
   Optimize content for the specified scene type (e.g., action_sequence, tension_buildup).
   
   /refine dialogue
   Make character voices more distinct and conversations more natural.
   
   /deepen description
