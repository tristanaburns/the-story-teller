## **üìñ The Shadow Team Chronicles - The Bridge of Fate**  

üåô The night was thick with mist and silence‚Äîthe kind of silence that lingers after a hundred battles have been fought on the same ground. A silence that remembers blood.  

Gojo Bridge stood like a scar across the river, its wooden planks worn smooth where warriors had tread, and splintered where they had fallen. The mist curled over it like the ghosts of the defeated, clinging to the old wood, waiting to claim another soul.  

It was not just a bridge. It was a graveyard of duels.  

### **üîª The Bridge That Would Decide Fate**  

üî• **The Evidence of War Still Lingers:**  

- Sword marks carved deep into the railings.  
- Gashes in the wood‚Äîsilent testaments to battles fought and lost.  
- A shattered pillar at the edge, broken by the force of a body hurled too hard, too fast.  
- A single, abandoned sandal near the bridge's entrance‚Äîtorn, soaked in dried blood.  

üìñ The bridge was not just old‚Äîit was used.  
üìñ It was a place where warriors came, and many never left.  

### **üî• And In the Center ‚Äì The Last Giant of the Bridge**  

Benkei stood like a statue‚Äîa titan among men.  

His **naginata** rested across his massive shoulders.  

He had already taken **999 swords**.  

Tonight, he would take the **thousandth**.  

üéµ A distant temple bell tolled.  

### **üî• Benkei's Challenge ‚Äì A Warrior's Demand**  

Benkei's voice came first‚Äîdeep, steady, and unwavering.  

**"You carry a sword."**  

It was not a question.  

It was a statement.  

**"I will take it."**  

### **üî• Yoshi's Response ‚Äì A Hawk's Smile**  

Yoshi finally looked at him.  

The air between them was charged‚Äîlike the breathless moment before lightning strikes.  

And then, **Yoshi smiled.**  

A small, knowing smirk. A smile not of arrogance, but of **amusement**.  

**"Then come and take it."**  

### **üî• The Bridge Was Silent. The Mist Waited. The Duel Was About to Begin.**  

üéµ The final toll of the temple bell echoed, as if the universe itself was watching.  

üî• The Hawk and the Bear, together for the first time.  

üî• And the world would never be the same.
