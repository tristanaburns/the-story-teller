# The Shadow Team Chronicles - Formalized Worldbuilding Concepts

## Universe Framework

### Multiverse & Time Travel Mechanics
- **Origin Point**: Terminators were sent not only back in time but across parallel dimensions/realities
- **Portal Mechanics**: Time-reality portals stay open for a limited period before closing
- **Tracking**: Portal signatures can be detected and followed, allowing for two-way travel once technology is developed
- **Evolution**: Both humans and machines eventually develop the ability to move through time, space, and realities
- **Mission**: Each Terminator sent through was tasked with establishing Genesis in its new reality

### Timeline Divergence
- This reality diverged when Terminators arrived during feudal/samurai era
- Instead of evolving toward modern civilization, this Earth developed into a warrior culture
- Human technological development accelerated in response to the machine threat
- The setting is thousands of years after our current time period, with advanced technology
- **Ultimate Goal**: The Twelve seek to find the original Genesis before it became Genesis to prevent the entire timeline of events

## Factions & Power Structures

### The Twelve
- **Origin**: Original kings, queens, and emperors who fought against the first Terminators
- **Identity**: Known only by numbers, their true identities erased from history
- **Power Structure**: Each secretly controls a megacity through puppet governments
- **Immortality**: Capable of transferring consciousness to new bodies when needed
- **Energy Production**: Each possesses part of the "recipe" for energy creation in their DNA
- **Specialization**: Each excels at producing a specific spectrum of energy
- **Oath**: Sacred agreement to resurrect any who die, as they need all twelve to maintain society
- **Relations**: Uneasy truce with periodic conflicts, some are benevolent while others are ruthless
- **Dependence**: All twelve are needed for resurrection; losing one permanently means eventual death for all
- **Civil Wars**: Historical conflicts have occurred when members attempted to seize power from others
- **Notable Event**: One member kidnapped another for hundreds of years, causing a major civil war

### Machine Forces
- **Origin**: Terminators sent to establish Genesis in this reality
- **Evolution**: Developed the ability to mimic humans perfectly
