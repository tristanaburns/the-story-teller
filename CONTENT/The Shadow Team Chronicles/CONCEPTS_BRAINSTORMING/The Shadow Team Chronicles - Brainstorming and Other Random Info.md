# The Shadow Team - Brainstorming and Building the Shadow Team Full Narrative Arc

It is, a very, very, very long time ago, in the obvious real timeline of the Terminator series on this Earth and Judgment Day and all the rest of it, that's going to be a reference point of the story. But what's happened is, not only did Genesis send robots back in time, they also sent them into a number of parallel dimensions or parallel realities. And each one of these realities, and as I've done this, it's a one-way transition, but then what's happened is that some of these back in time and across reality portals for the Terminator robots, or just the, we'll call them Terminator robots for now, what's happened is that there's different realities of what's happened to Genesis, and essentially Genesis has tried to continue to play this out. So as these special robots are uncovered, they're actually very unique in that they've got all the history of the original Genesis and where they've come from, and they've also got details of where the other robots are based on where they were, at what point in time they arrived in this alternate reality or alternate universe. Thank you. Did you catch that last bit?

###### ChatGPT said

Yes, I understand, we'll incorporate that. ðŸ”¥

##### You said

Okay, just tell me in two sentences what I just said in the last one.

###### ChatGPT said

Genesis not only sent Terminators back in time but also across multiple parallel realities, creating different versions of its influence in each universe. Some of these Terminators retain the original Genesisâ€™s history and knowledge of where other units were sent, making them key to uncovering the larger multiversal plan. ðŸ”¥

##### You said

Yeah, and in this particular reality where the story is currently, essentially,

###### ChatGPT said

Yes, I understand, we'll incorporate that. ðŸ”¥

##### You said

Yeah, and so what's happened is the humanoid inhabitants of this particular reality, which is the same Earth, it's just a different reality, what's happened is, because this happened a long time ago when there was samurais and ninjas and warriors, and of course all the other Dark Age, Middle Age influences were present, instead of the Earth evolving to a more peaceful one like ours, it evolved into an entire warrior culture.

###### ChatGPT said

Yes, I understand, we'll incorporate that. ðŸ”¥

##### You said

And part of this warrior culture, there was a development of a and unification of humans when Genesis began to basically populate and colonize and take over this reality. So the humans essentially banded together, given they had vastly inferior technologies, but it took many, many years for Genesis to establish itself from the original Terminator. So the idea is that as they send Terminators back in time and or across realities, its mission was to establish another Genesis in that reality. And it had to basically develop its own technologies, metalworking, and other things to be able to develop mechanized warfare and computer systems to simulate Genesis.

###### ChatGPT said

Yes, I understand, we'll incorporate that. ðŸ”¥

##### You said

Now, there's going to be an obvious loophole here about going backwards and forwards in time and across realities, so at some stage what will happen is there'll be an evolutionary point in time where the people in this reality, where the book is situated, actually develop these same technology capabilities themselves.

###### ChatGPT said

Yes, I understand, we'll incorporate that. ðŸ”¥

##### You said

And so what the 12 are trying to do is essentially find the real Genesis before it became Genesis to destroy it so none of this is ever possible. That's going to be kind of the idea.

###### ChatGPT said

Yes, I understand, we'll incorporate that. ðŸ”¥

##### You said

So this is the reason why they have such longevity and can live forever, basically, but have to keep changing their forms, is because they have an eternal struggle to develop and try to destroy the term down.

###### ChatGPT said

Yes, I understand, we'll incorporate that. ðŸ”¥

##### You said

So to go a bit sideways again on some of the ideas, so in this particular reality, because it's been thousands of years after this current human reality, as in the real world that I live in, and because it's had such a long time and total war with machines for a very long time, they've actually evolved their technology way past what we in this reality have done, and thus so the future reality that the story starts in, where they've actually been directly more highly evolved than what they would be otherwise.

###### ChatGPT said

Yes, I understand, we'll incorporate that. ðŸ”¥

##### You said

So therefore, because of that, each human civilization who is invaded by the Terminators, eventually, or most of them, or some of them, if they survive long enough, develop the same type of technology to be able to move through space and time and universes at their will.

###### ChatGPT said

Yes, I understand, we'll incorporate that. ðŸ”¥

##### You said

Now one thing we're going to have to think about, and this is going to be an interesting one, is the fact that when these time rips, we'll call them, or universe rips, or whatever we're going to call them, when they occur, they stay open for a period of time and then essentially close. So there is the ability to be able to track the lineage of these particular time rips, portals, wormholes, whatever they're going to be. So you can actually find out where they've come from and the technology, once it's developed, you can look back into time when it happened, because it leaves some sort of signature, and you can go back to that point when it was opened or closed, and then actually go through back the other way, because it's a two-way portal.

###### ChatGPT said

Yes, I understand, we'll incorporate that. ðŸ”¥

##### You said

Now a bit about the technology evolution of our particular heroes in the 12 in the story. So essentially what's happened is that they've developed biology as their primary weapon. Now what I mean by biology, if I mean that they've developed their biological technology so far that all the humans are hyper-intelligent, they live for a very long time, they're extremely strong, it's essentially they've made themselves as strong as the robots, and essentially what they can do is that they've actually got a mechanism to mask from the Terminators that they're human. Except for when you do a particular test or something like that, the Terminators can capture people and do a test on them to find out whether they're human or not. Now conversely, the Terminators have also evolved their ability to essentially fully assimilate to be human in this part of the world. So what's happened is there are basically megacities of humans and robots which have great distances between them, and also people and robots live underground, they live in the sky, they live wherever, and essentially there's this great big standoff between both parties where each side, they're not fighting as such, but there's always skirmishes and infiltrations by the Terminators and all the humans to try to destroy each other.

###### ChatGPT said

Yes, I understand, we'll incorporate that. ðŸ”¥

##### You said

And so because the humans have developed so well with biology, what's also occurred is obviously mutations and other challenges where people have had too much biology, engineering, whatever you want to call it, or human engineering, where there can be times where people become mutated, they become different than themselves, they might turn, they might grow additional limbs, and once those things kind of occur, they can never replace those elements of their body, they're stuck with it forever. So as long as the biological engineering is successful, the humans can live forever, but eventually, like cancer, eventually it catches up with people. So that's why the 12 have developed the technology to be able to keep living by essentially creating clones of themselves and then implanting their digitized consciousness into these humans. And that is obviously highly illegal, and it's punishable by death.

###### ChatGPT said

Yes, I understand, we'll incorporate that. ðŸ”¥

##### You said

So one of the sub-stories is obviously the human population themselves. Because of this technology and its existence, although extremely rare it does exist, there are special units and organizations which are hunting these people down, or this technology down, to find the source of the technology to destroy it, because it goes against the laws of the world.

###### ChatGPT said

Yes, I understand, we'll incorporate that. ðŸ”¥

##### You said

And probably the origins of the human technology has to be reviewed a bit, as in, there needs to be a pivotal moment or a reason or a special something which enabled the humans to be able to engineer themselves in such a way. But this happened a long time ago before my reality's current technology, where we can start to grow limbs and stuff like this, happened way before. And there was some pivotal moment, some special event, which unlocked the secrets to be able to do that. And we've been accelerating it ever since.

###### ChatGPT said

Yes, I understand, we'll incorporate that. ðŸ”¥

##### You said

And so, what's also part of this as well is that the human technology is essentially for, instead of having mechanized technology, they have organic computerized technology, where essentially large human nerve centers act as supercomputers to be a cybernetic but human massive online data processing capability.

###### ChatGPT said

Yes, I understand, we'll incorporate that. ðŸ”¥

##### You said

And the particular analogy of this is that our current internet in our current reality here, there's an equivalency, but it's run by these bionic, or should I say cybernetic, or biological nerve centers, which are the human-computer equivalency. And they're all connected by something, obviously like a nerve network or something like that. And we've got to come up with a name for that particular thing.

###### ChatGPT said

Yes, I understand, we'll incorporate that. ðŸ”¥

##### You said

So what humans are able to do is they're actually able to implant these human computer

###### ChatGPT said

Yes, I understand, we'll incorporate that. ðŸ”¥

##### You said

And so what the humans are able to do is they're actually able to provide a proper real biological consciousness to machines.

###### ChatGPT said

Yes, I understand, we'll incorporate that. ðŸ”¥

##### You said

And this is how the humans actually were able to stop the Terminators from destroying them, because they were able to actually take over the Terminators. So the Terminators in their defense made it so the humans couldn't work out whether the human in front of them was an actual human or it was a Terminator, because it had the ability to mask the human's ability to observe them as being a mechanical robot.

###### ChatGPT said

Yes, I understand, we'll incorporate that. ðŸ”¥

##### You said

So on.

###### ChatGPT said

Yes, I understand, we'll incorporate that. ðŸ”¥

##### You said

So on the human side, when they create technology, they have the ability to have a subconscious level operating environment for a drone, a car, a tank, a blender, or whatever, and that does its basic equivalent electronic functions, but it's all human nerve electronic functions. It's all human-based or biological-based computer systems.

###### ChatGPT said

Yes, I understand, we'll incorporate that. ðŸ”¥

##### You said

And because of this, there are very tightly regulated rules on what level of consciousness mechanical or electronic or whatever devices that humans make, to what level they can actually be conscious. So, for example, they can create robots which have a full consciousness or a car or whatever, but that is tightly controlled. And of course, they're organic, so they break down over time and they have to be replaced. So you have the same mechanism of aging, but it's actually over a very long period of time.

###### ChatGPT said

Yes, I understand, we'll incorporate that. ðŸ”¥

##### You said

And so obviously because of this, there's been a lot of experimentation where things like a toaster or an oven or a TV or whatever have actually been given a full human consciousness and operate independently of that. But obviously another point to make here is that the more the devices have organic nerve centres, the more they have to consume in terms of resources. So the humans have come up with a very special energy to supplement these devices with the resources they need to supply.

###### ChatGPT said

Yes, I understand, we'll incorporate that. ðŸ”¥

##### You said

And so this particular energy source is a fluid in nature, and it can be far more powerful than nuclear fusion or nuclear fission. But it also has different purposes based on its color spectrum. So it has an array of different colors that it can be, and that provides different capabilities and different energy types to the mechanical devices.

###### ChatGPT said

Yes, I understand, we'll incorporate that. ðŸ”¥

##### You said

And so, for example, when there's no energy running through a particular, we'll call it a mechanical device or a biological device, the actual thing is translucent, because the actual energy it is itself gives it its color, as in, it has defined colors like a white car is a white car, but when it doesn't have power, it becomes translucent and you can't see through it, but it doesn't look, it looks very dull and lifeless. It needs this particular energy source to run it.

###### ChatGPT said

Yes, I understand, we'll incorporate that. ðŸ”¥

##### You said

And so what so example is the base color for anything for any for all energy all generic energy throughout the world is white. It's a like a very stark white liquid and it's made from rare materials and also biological

###### ChatGPT said

Yes, I understand, we'll incorporate that. ðŸ”¥

##### You said

So it's basically like equivalents of stem cells in humans, but amped up to an amazing exponential amount, coupled with pure electricity, photons, and other things, where basically it can change not only from a biological point of view to anything it wants, but also from a physical or mechanical point of view, where it can supply a with energy, but also it can provide a level of

###### ChatGPT said

Yes, I understand, we'll incorporate that. ðŸ”¥

##### You said

The Terminators know this is if you take away the energy source for something, it can't operate.

###### ChatGPT said

Yes, I understand, we'll incorporate that. ðŸ”¥

##### You said

And so what the Terminators have done, they've essentially been able to take that particular technology and that's where they use to hide themselves in human population.

###### ChatGPT said

Yes, I understand, we'll incorporate that. ðŸ”¥

##### You said

So this particular reality of Terminators, what they're trying to do is they're actually trying to evolve themselves into humans and to take a symbolic human form, but are actually obviously Terminators. So what can happen conversely is that the Terminators can actually, through this illegal technology that we're talking about, imprint themselves in humans, but there's a very high chance that they actually kill the host themselves. So what happens is that there's a digital consciousness inside of organic organisms.

###### ChatGPT said

Yes, I understand, we'll incorporate that. ðŸ”¥

##### You said

And so the humans, to be able to discover whether the digital consciousness has been put into an organic thing, they have to do a brain scan or a special type of scan over the entire human, over the entire organism, to basically look at its nerve centers and structure to see whether it's got a digital imprint of the digital consciousness or whether it's got an organic imprint of the organic consciousness.

###### ChatGPT said

Yes, I understand, we'll incorporate that. ðŸ”¥

##### You said

Now, in terms of general technologies and firepower and things like that,

###### ChatGPT said

Yes, I understand, we'll incorporate that. ðŸ”¥

##### You said

So there's essentially plasma and laser-based weapons as well as ballistic weapons. There's all different types of weapons and they're used for various purposes. So example is certain laser weapons can't cut through certain metal or certain objects and ballistic weapons can't go through certain types of laser fields or electromagnetic fields and things like that. So there's obvious tactical advantages for running each type of weapon systems based on what you're attacking.

###### ChatGPT said

Yes, I understand, we'll incorporate that. ðŸ”¥

##### You said

And so we'll now bring in to another type of reality which I really like, it's the idea of the JudgeDread megacity concept and how people live.

###### ChatGPT said

Yes, I understand, we'll incorporate that. ðŸ”¥

##### You said

So with the particular Judge Dredge-style idea is that just because there's so many people and it's so hard to police and blah-de-blah, the idea is that the law enforcement is optimised where there is the idea of a police, judges, jury, lawyers, etc, but it all happens in process and it all happens in virtual reality where virtual hearings that happen and occur for the system and that's how people are essentially kept in control because anywhere at any given time if you're connected to this nerve centre, which is the equivalent of the internet, you can be brought in and you can be controlled.

###### ChatGPT said

Yes, I understand, we'll incorporate that. ðŸ”¥

##### You said

and so the next obvious step here is that so for people to be be able to be biologically engineered and to stay alive they need this special energy to be basically injected into them it's a special color it's going to be like green or pink or something

###### ChatGPT said

Yes, I understand, we'll incorporate that. ðŸ”¥

##### You said

And that's how people evolve and become better. But also, for the population to be able to access this technology, they have to be connected in part or in full to the particular human AI, the human AI nerve center, the internet, we'll call it, just for lack of a better phrase.

###### ChatGPT said

Yes, I understand, we'll incorporate that. ðŸ”¥

##### You said

And so there's a delicate balance where people have autonomy from this particular biologic AI nerve center. They don't have to be connected all the time, but to get the particular energy, they need to be connected for periods of time. And so the more you're connected, the more energy you get, and thus the more you can, the smarter you are, the stronger you are, the better you are, based on the particular flavors of the energy that you're actually taking in.

###### ChatGPT said

Yes, I understand, we'll incorporate that. ðŸ”¥

##### You said

And the technology for people to evolve this biological engineering is actually orchestrated by these massive biologic computers. So what they do is they keep people alive, they keep them running, the people can basically take the blueprints or whatever we're going to call it from these machines and to be able to evolve their bodies. So they become incredibly intelligent, incredibly strong, fit, whatever the case may be. But obviously this wears off over time. So people have to be reconnected back into the human internet, the human nerve centre, to be able to get the energy and the organic engineering.

###### ChatGPT said

Yes, I understand, we'll incorporate that. ðŸ”¥

##### You said

And so part of the fabric, and I guess the underworld part of this as well, is that this energy is like a drug to some people, but for others it's just a way of life. And for others, again, they don't actually take it at all, and they live free from the nerve centre, and they live organically in the population as well. But they're obviously seen as inferior and hippies or something like that, and where the rest of the world is just considered

###### ChatGPT said

Yes, I understand, we'll incorporate that. ðŸ”¥

##### You said

And so essentially, with people, if they've taken this particular energy source and have evolved their body, what will happen is that they'll actually start to rot and decay if they've used a particular technology. So they constantly need to be pumped up, and whatever they've changed in their body, for example, if they've enhanced their muscles in their right arm only, then what will happen is over time, that part of their body will actually start to die quicker than the rest of their body. And so they need this particular energy to then stabilize them and bring them back to normal.

###### ChatGPT said

Yes, I understand, we'll incorporate that. ðŸ”¥

##### You said

So we can also consider this type of energy as like a currency or credits or whatever the case may be for as it's one of the type of credits for human civilization to be able to function.

###### ChatGPT said

Yes, I understand, we'll incorporate that. ðŸ”¥

##### You said

And then obviously there's, when I go back to the black market, there's obviously different variations of this particular energy which gives people unusual powers or whatever the case may be. Or they be, but it comes at the cost of having to have it a lot more and then they become addicted to it where they have to live, they have to have it all the time. It's like an addictive, very addictive drug because otherwise they'll die.

###### ChatGPT said

Yes, I understand, we'll incorporate that. ðŸ”¥

##### You said

And then because of this, there's obviously also different qualities. So there's like really bad street quality energy, which is essentially like dirty drugs. Whereas the different levels of society have access to the most cleanest and most refined energy, which enables them to have all these wonderful additional benefits, but barely any side effects. But it's still the same base thing, but it just doesn't damage them as much and allows them to live longer, or allows them to not have to retake more energy in for longer.

###### ChatGPT said

Yes, I understand, we'll incorporate that. ðŸ”¥

##### You said

We're going to stop there for now because I've got to go to an appointment. We'll continue this later.

###### ChatGPT said

Understood! Weâ€™ve built an incredible foundation so far. When youâ€™re ready to continue, weâ€™ll pick up right where we left off. ðŸ”¥

##### You said

Now I am just text messaging... So it's not going to be so descriptive... But I am going to write a couple of thing to incorporate... Keep with the same idea of just taking notes

###### ChatGPT said

Yes, I understand, I'll incorporate that. ðŸ”¥

##### You said

This energy is produced by large mega organisations which are equivalent to governments of these mega cities...

###### ChatGPT said

Yes, I understand, I'll incorporate that. ðŸ”¥

##### You said

The mega cities are essentially giant fortresses... And were originally castles, keeps and other mediaeval structures... That evolved over time

###### ChatGPT said

Yes, I understand, I'll incorporate that. ðŸ”¥

##### You said

Ok to expand the energy concepts ... There are 2 ways to describe the energies in their purest form. The light energy in its purest form has the energy of a sun. The dark energy in its purest form has the power of a black hole. All other energy types are derived from these 2 source types. The way the energy is made is by creating a sun and / or a black hole in a special machine. Where foundation elements, bioorganic elements, and other rare natural elements are combined which absorb the energy from the sun or black hole. The elements used to absorb the energy define its properties and colours.

###### ChatGPT said

Yes, I understand, I'll incorporate that. ðŸ”¥

##### You said

One of the mega companies that make the energy will have a name something like "Voidtech" to signify the use black holes to make energy

###### ChatGPT said

Yes, I understand, I'll incorporate that. ðŸ”¥

##### You said

All righty, we're back on the air with voice, so I'm going to continue adding some of my ideas and you're just going to write them.

###### ChatGPT said

Yes, I understand, I'll incorporate that. ðŸ”¥

##### You said

Okay, so another angle, or another thought I had, is around why the Terminators are trying to hunt the humans even more, is because at some point in the future of the series or novels, the Terminators discover that the humans can digitize their consciousness and imprint it into other living beings without the consequences that the Terminators have with doing it. So this means they can freely assimilate into the environment, into the human environment and manipulate their infrastructure. So at some point in time they're going to discover people can do this, and that it's possible, and they're going to start hunting the Twelve who can do it, and and other very, very important powerful people will start being killed because of this technology.

###### ChatGPT said

Yes, I understand, I'll incorporate that. ðŸ”¥

##### You said

And this particular thing, when the terminators find out they're doing this, and the people learn that this technology still exists and it is around, there'll be some mass rioting where the rich and famous will be taken from their homes when they're trying to find people who can digitize their consciousness. And some very other people who have digitized their consciousness will be found and killed and all that kind of stuff. There'll be lots of mass mass killings, a lot of rioting, civil wars or civil wars that break out within the megacities, and it'll turn into absolute chaos for a while. Another thing I was thinking of as well was around the 12, where some of the original kings and monarchy emperors and stuff from when the robots first landed,

2/2

###### ChatGPT said

Yes, I understand, I'll incorporate that. ðŸ”¥

##### You said

And while they were fighting against the original Terminators that were coming through the portal and established them themselves, while they didn't fully succeed in destroying them all, they were able to steal their technology and insert somehow reason, were able to greatly advance their own technologies and discovered that they could extend their lives by mixing certain materials together, rare earth materials, some other organic matter, and this is how the whole process started. And the way that they create energy from this and then consume it is just a concentrated version of the original recipes that were made up, which were predominantly thought to be magic.

###### ChatGPT said

Yes, I understand, I'll incorporate that. ðŸ”¥

##### You said

And so, what happened is that there was some sort of really, really rare Earth meteorite or something to hit the planet. We'll call it Unobtainium for now, or whatever you want to call it. Starlight, Stardust, something like that. And some of the founding members used that as some sort of paste or ointment or something, or maybe they were using it for their war paint weapons, something like that. And this particular material, when mixed in certain quantities and consumed through skin or through ingestion, maybe they made special cups out of it or something. That's not a bad idea. They made special cups and there was particular drinks and stuff that were mixed in these cups, or maybe there were pots that were cooked in it. We're giving these people long lives, but only certain people were living this long. And then the history is that these particular metallic objects, because there was a plentiful amount of it, were discovered and essentially there was some mass extraction or mass collections of this particular material because people wanted to live forever. And this started the process of being able to live longer. But also the same material can also be threaded or bonded to other metals to become super strong or it dramatically increases the particular strength of particular metals. And so they were able to discover this and were able to weave it into their weapons, which was ultimately how a medieval group were able to withstand the Terminators and their advanced technologies because the Terminators couldn't penetrate the particular armour that the warriors were wearing. So they were able to take them down with relative ease.

###### ChatGPT said

Yes, I understand, I'll incorporate that. ðŸ”¥

##### You said

Now this will obviously be a great story, another one of those backstory ones where the humans were initially slaughtered, but over time they were able to, but they were just in the process discovering this particular way of being able to craft weapons, and also they were able to melt down the fallen perimeters that they actually were able to bring down and use their own metals to craft these particular technology as well.

###### ChatGPT said

Yes, I understand, I'll incorporate that. ðŸ”¥

##### You said

Now I wouldn't mind covering some of the Nindus weapons, one of the twelve, we'll call him Yoshi, because what I'm thinking is that the actual twelve will be like I said the original founding kings, queens, emperors, or hierarchy, and they only refer to each other as numbers, so therefore they're only known forever as those numbers because their history has been erased from the earth.

###### ChatGPT said

Yes, I understand, I'll incorporate that. ðŸ”¥

##### You said

And part of the story, or something along these lines, is that these 12 actually are running, each one of them has their own megacity that they're actually secretly running, but they've got a set of governing people who think they're in charge, but there's only a select few in the whole universe who know who the 12 are, and also which ones really run the megacity. It's like an underground secret society type scenario, who are then running all these governments, who are running all the megacities.

###### ChatGPT said

Yes, I understand, I'll incorporate that. ðŸ”¥

##### You said

And we'll add that some of the 12 over time have become greedy and ruthless, and there's actually been wars between the 12, between particular parties of the 12, and essentially some of them have, they all have an uneasy truce at the moment, but at any stage they could break out into war again to fight over the power to generate this energy.

###### ChatGPT said

Yes, I understand, I'll incorporate that. ðŸ”¥

##### You said

The reason why that is so important and they have an uneasy truce is because each one of them has part of their recipe to create the energy interwoven into their DNA. So they are the actual keys to creating the energy because they have the actual knowledge within their DNA, within their biological mass themselves. So when essentially one of the 12 dies and they're restored because they're able to restore themselves to another human, essentially what happens is that the other surviving members use their own DNA and the energy that they've got or the energy that's within them, shall we say, to be able to restore that one of the missing 12 back into another body or their own body, depending on how we go, because I want them to be clones. But maybe in the past they kept restoring themselves back to, or at some point they realised they could do this and they could restore their team, one of their 12, back into another body.

###### ChatGPT said

Yes, I understand, I'll incorporate that. ðŸ”¥

##### You said

And also each of the 12 has a particular type of energy that they produce the most of. So each one of them can produce every spectrum of energy, but each one of the 12 has a particular way and can basically mass produce this energy far greater than the other one of a particular type. And so there is essentially a bit of a power struggle because obviously there's the usual free market and all that kind of jazz, even though it's a warrior community, where at particular times there's the induced or accidental shortages of different types of energy to make their entire societies work, because now the megacities are purely reliant on this particular energy to be made.

###### ChatGPT said

Yes, I understand, I'll incorporate that. ðŸ”¥

##### You said

And so, there is also a sacred oath that all the 12 have taken for when one of them dies, the others must resurrect them. Otherwise, if they don't have all the 12 running, they can't keep the whole society going. And also, they need all of the 12 to be able to resurrect. So, if they lose one permanently and someone chooses not to resurrect them, then they all will eventually die.

###### ChatGPT said

Yes, I understand, I'll incorporate that. ðŸ”¥

##### You said

And there will be some sort of subplot line or story where one of the 12 kidnaps the family and then eventually another one of the 12 and holds them captive for hundreds of years. It's going to be a bit of a back story. And so at one point in time that he was actually rescued by his own group and then that's how one of the civil wars started.

###### ChatGPT said

Yes, I understand, I'll incorporate that. ðŸ”¥

##### You said

because the captor who imprisoned the other member of the Twelve said that he was trying to bargain with his life to take over his megacity, and that obviously backfired because he escaped. And so while in the process of taking over the other one of the Twelve's megacity, that was the point where they escaped and there was a rebellion which turned into an all-out civil war.

###### ChatGPT said

Yes, I understand, I'll incorporate that. ðŸ”¥

##### You said

So while there's an uneasy truce between the different megacities of the Twelve, there's also regular skirmishes and sabotage, spying, espionage, all the usual stuff that happens from the human condition when there's a group of people appearing to work together for a common good, but really some of them are out to take over completely and imprison the others, while some want to work together for the goodness of mankind.

###### ChatGPT said

Yes, I understand, I'll incorporate that. ðŸ”¥

##### You said

So Al7, who's our ninja, who's our shadow, who's our cyber shadow warrior, for lack of a better phrase, let's talk about his particular weapons and technologies that he's got, and we'll make it that all of the other 12 have different technologies and weapons, all of which are just as significant as each other.

###### ChatGPT said

Yes, I understand, I'll incorporate that. ðŸ”¥

##### You said

Okay, can you just repeat what I said just then?

###### ChatGPT said

Yes! You said that **AL7**, the **Ninja/Shadow/Cyber Warrior**, has his own unique weapons and technologies, and that each of the other Twelve also has their own distinct technologies and weapons, all of which are equally significant and powerful in their own way. ðŸ”¥

##### You said

So I'm going to kind of try to model each one of the 12 on a combination of different martial arts and warrior heroes from the Japanese and medieval times, feudal times. So for example, our ninja warrior was, I don't know, let's call him a shogun, a king ninja, or he was like the emperor's general or something like that, who ended up rising to power because the emperor was killed through the particular wars with the terminators. And so as the general, he took over and he was able to beat them back and he was the first one to discover the technology used for using it with armor. And so his primary ways of fighting is a traditional Japanese style.

###### ChatGPT said

Yes, I understand, I'll incorporate that. ðŸ”¥

##### You said

So obviously we've already sort of got a rough idea of what he looks like, but we'll talk about his weapons and his armor and his general capability.

###### ChatGPT said

Yes, I understand, I'll incorporate that. ðŸ”¥

##### You said

So his primary weapons are blades, so knives, spears, katanas, shurikens, wakizashi, the big long double-handled weapons, whatever particular Japanese-style weapons he chooses. And he basically has a lot of them all over his suit, so at any given time he's got a mass amount of consumable weapons, plus also his big weapons on his back.

###### ChatGPT said

Yes, I understand, I'll incorporate that. ðŸ”¥

##### You said

So obviously his primary striking weapon will be a larger than normal katana and then he'll also have a secondary katana plus wakizashi, plus knives that he keeps on his boots and things like that.

###### ChatGPT said

Yes, I understand, I'll incorporate that. ðŸ”¥

##### You said

So, um, also what he's got, so he mainly fights with the, with the melee weapons in his left hand, oh sorry, his right hand, but in his left hand he's got that

###### ChatGPT said

Yes, I understand, I'll incorporate that. ðŸ”¥

##### You said

So in his left hand he can fire a spear like Scorpion from the Mortal Kombat series, which is actually just a little, which is just a spear dart and it has a cable attached to it and that cable is amazingly long distances and it is extremely strong. It's built from whatever the most advanced carbonite graphene style technology they've got at the time and what this cable, what's great about this particular weapon is that it can carry the energy, the different spectrums of energy through the cable and that can perform different things.

###### ChatGPT said

Yes, I understand, I'll incorporate that. ðŸ”¥

##### You said

So one example is that he can fire the spear off with the cable attached, and an actual cable, when there's no power going through it, is translucent. So it looks like fishing line, but it's extremely strong. It can, for example, tie up a terminator and pin them against a wall, and they can't break free. It's sort of like equivalent of a spider web, sort of tensile strength, but relative to the size of the humanoids and the people.

###### ChatGPT said

Yes, I understand, I'll incorporate that. ðŸ”¥

2/2

##### You said

And just to continue on from what I was saying about his spear with cable, so his ability or his ability or special skill with that particular cable is to be able to power the spearhead to do, to morph and change into different things. So an example could be that if he's powered through, if he sends power down the cable to the spearhead, it could split off into two or three different spearheads and then the cable splits and then two, three, four, whatever, spears come out from this particular, an original spearhead, but obviously they're a little bit smaller, and it can create like a net or it can create a, like a, something to trap people or trap terminators or something like that.

Yes, I understand, I'll incorporate that. ðŸ”¥

##### You said

So obviously he commonly uses it as a grappling tool, so he can fire it off, put a little bit of pulse of energy, and it turns it into a grapple at the right time to then hook up into the wherever he's going, and it can automatically retract as well, so it pulls him along. The retraction thing as well can be done really quickly or really slowly, it's variable, and so for example he could fire it into a target, turn on the retractor, and then pull the person forward to then say slice them or cut them or something like that for dramatic sort of scene entrances. And there is, like some of the Marvel movies where Groot sends his roots through multiple opponents and then flicks them around and cuts them up and makes a mess of them, this is what he does as well, and sometimes he goes a bit overboard and a bit brutal, but that's part of his bloodlust from his days of fighting as a general.

###### ChatGPT said

Yes, I understand, I'll incorporate that. ðŸ”¥

##### You said

And so next thing we'll talk about is his armor and how that integrates with all of his weapon systems that he's got. So his armor looks like a modern version, very very modern version, of Japanese samurai or ninjutsu armor. It's very obviously very tough etc etc. All the usual stories around that. He has a mask obviously as well. He has the actual mask he's got can also turn into a full on a full environmental suit helmet and the same thing with the rest of his particular armor as well. So it's a multi-layered capable armor protecting him from all environmental things including heat and all the rest of it like that. His cloak is quite special and we'll cover that in a

###### ChatGPT said

Yes, I understand, I'll incorporate that. ðŸ”¥

##### You said

So his cloak is quite special in the sense of the relative size of the fabric that makes it up. So this is more of a broad thing I'll say about the whole technologies around, and then we'll go back into this. So one thing that humans have done, and have done really well, is use equivalent of nanotechnology or nanobots, and they've been able to imprint them with basic unconsciousness to go and perform tasks. So this is also one of their ways they've always been able to fix and heal themselves, is by sending these robots in for medical purposes. This is how it all began, when they were initially programming them with the human bionic megaminds, we'll call them for now, for AI minds. It was not really AI, it's part of the human internet, the living human internet, and what happens there essentially is it evolved further and further to be able to control these particular bots as a massive swarm, and they got smaller and smaller. So initially started out being able to be quite small, like the size of a mosquito or something like that, and they've evolved all the way down and down and down into single cell size nanobots, and even lower. So his particular cloak is special in the sense that it's made up of all these tiny, tiny, tiny nanobots, who are made from the strongest metals and components, but not of that special rare earth element.

###### ChatGPT said

Yes, I understand, I'll incorporate that. ðŸ”¥

##### You said

And so because of this particular cloak and what it actually is made from, these little tiny, tiny micro nanobots, we're going to have to come up with a special name for them, all the different sizes, so we have a like a scaling way of describing them. But essentially what they do is they operate like material, but they can change their shape, their form, their function. So it looks like a standard cloak, but it's really made of these bots. And so that's how he's able to conceal himself, because they essentially rearrange to be able to hide him and reflect light and mirror what's going on around them. And that's the essence of why he's so good at hiding, is because these bots in his cloak are actually doing all that work for him.

###### ChatGPT said

Yes, I understand, I'll incorporate that. ðŸ”¥

##### You said

And now back onto his armor again. So his armor is also very special because what he's able to do, because he can use the energy and fire it in and basically use the spectrums of energy to run his spear, he's also able to call on bursts of energy to make his other weapons, when holding them, be able to do particular things. So for example, his normal weapons he's got there, like his katana, for example, if there's a particular barrier in the way, so let's say it's rock or something like that, or something that you wouldn't normally use a katana to hit with, he can actually create an energy on the edge of the katana, so maybe like a few mil or something like that, or maybe a bit more, depending on what he needs to do. And he ignites it with a particular spectrum of energy which is able to...

###### ChatGPT said

Yes, I understand, I'll incorporate that. ðŸ”¥

##### You said

So what you see when he's using that particular technology, so he might be powering it up to cut through some metal. So what will happen is that you'll see his arm guard and his glove start to illuminate with a particular color spectrum, which is going to make his weapon he's holding in his hand be able to cut through whatever he's trying to cut through. So if it was metal it might turn into like a gray blue color or something like that, something to the similar color of the metal. And then once it's illuminated he's then able to slice through it because it's made of the same type of thing or maybe it's made of something completely opposite to it and that's how he's able to actually destroy it by using a matter-antimatter approach.

###### ChatGPT said

Yes, I understand, I'll incorporate that. ðŸ”¥

##### You said

and he's able to manipulate the particular weapons and that's because he's holding it in his hand in his gloves. He needs his glove, needs his arm guards and they essentially has it that's the main thing for his arm guards but also his arm guards can operate as computer equipment as well and his gloves can change shape to be able to change into different lock and this is obviously because he's got these tiny little robots in his cloak and part of that cloak can also they can also come off of the cloak itself and then make his armor turn into different things or add different elements to his armor and because these robots are so strong they can also but rarely do because every time they get hit they die they can actually shield him.

###### ChatGPT said

Yes, I understand, I'll incorporate that. ðŸ”¥

##### You said

And also these robots have the ability to power and transfer consciousness, their own consciousness, or you need lots of them to transfer it through into other objects as well. But that's more of a general thing that they can do, or special types of ones they can do it, and that's probably too much for him to be able to do, but that's just an example.

###### ChatGPT said

Yes, I understand, I'll incorporate that. ðŸ”¥

##### You said

there also his armor um specifically on the left hand side while it can fire a spear

###### ChatGPT said

Yes, I understand, I'll incorporate that. ðŸ”¥

##### You said

So the cartridges are there for his spear gun, we'll call it, or his retractable spear.

###### ChatGPT said

Yes, I understand, I'll incorporate that. ðŸ”¥

##### You said

But also his arm guard and his gloves on his left hand side can also do other things like they can fire rapid fire darts, little tiny darts, either poisonous or tracking darts or whatever the case may be. And a lot of the utility belt and pouches he's got are actually these magazines which are essentially a special type of metal which the actual arm guard itself manipulates and turns it into these little darts or little shuriken or whatever the case may be to fire off into the air, fire from the glove or from the arm guard itself.

###### ChatGPT said

Yes, I understand, I'll incorporate that. ðŸ”¥

##### You said

Now obviously if he's powering up his weapons and firing all this stuff off, it's using energy as well. So his main chest guard and his back guard is essentially a giant energy storage. So while it's all dark on the outside, on the inside it actually looks like a swirling array of different colors mixing and molding, a bit like a lava lamp but all the different colors that are there. And essentially what happens is as he's using his armor, all the color dulls and eventually goes, when his armor runs out of energy, it eventually, all that color is drained out of it. So that's essentially how he powers all his weapons and all of his bits and pieces. So every time he's doing work, obviously every time he uses strength or has his armor become extra powerful when he's doing a kick or a punch or whatever the case may be, it does drain the power in his armor itself. And this is why the opening book has the drones come down and give him additional weapons, because sometimes obviously weapons break, but he also needs refill cartridges for the metal that turns into projectiles, plus also he needs refill on energy as well.

###### ChatGPT said

Yes, I understand, I'll incorporate that. ðŸ”¥

##### You said

Now, just as another character, which is not part of the 12, but is mentioned in the opening story, is a person called Maestro.

###### ChatGPT said

Yes, I understand, I'll incorporate that. ðŸ”¥

##### You said

Yeah, so Maestro is essentially a, let's call him a operations manager and operations controller for Theven. Theven met Maestro during the 80s. He was a big businessman, sorry, the equivalent of the 80s, but in the warrior culture scenario we're talking about with their particular universe. So it was very much like a weird sort of 80s feel to it, but they were obviously warriors. So it's a combination of, imagine like a big business American style city, but also what it turned into, or he found him in a particular city like that and he ended up convincing him to come work for him to control his particular energy business or something like that.

###### ChatGPT said

Yes, I understand, I'll incorporate that. ðŸ”¥

##### You said

So Maestro himself is a psychopath, but he's not a killer psychopath. He's more, a bit more like a sociopath psychopath, but he's purely ruthless in business and running companies. So he's the actual person who runs 7th Government and organizations and companies for his megacity.

###### ChatGPT said

Yes, I understand, I'll incorporate that. ðŸ”¥

##### You said

So the personality of, obviously, Maestro is a flamboyant American feeling, but not with a bad American accent. He can have an accent, or whatever the case may be, but it's like a big-business American callous, ruthless psychopath who will stop at nothing to win and to make money.

###### ChatGPT said

Yes, I understand, I'll incorporate that. ðŸ”¥

##### You said

And so what's Maestro's primary job when he's working with Yoshi is he is essentially coordinating all of the functionality. You can draw it akin to Alfred and Batman. It's probably the best way to describe their relationship.

###### ChatGPT said

Yes, I understand, I'll incorporate that. ðŸ”¥

##### You said

But obviously with the obvious personality differences, they've been through it thick and thin, whatever the case may be, because Maestro's been living for a very long time. He obviously doesn't know, or he doesn't have the capability to transfer his consciousness like Yoshi does, but he does have the ability to transfer his conscious digitally. So he's one of the few people who can do that in the world. And so these two have been going along for thousands of years together, building their empire and keeping humans safe.

###### ChatGPT said

Yes, I understand, I'll incorporate that. ðŸ”¥

##### You said

And there's also going to be another character, I can't decide exactly what form they'll take, but it's going to be part of the idea of it, and maybe it's going to end up being something to do with the storyline itself of the first story. The character is an artificial intelligence, which is a copy, oh hang on, here we go, so this thing is called Echo Mind, and Echo Mind is a digital copy of the person, and Echo Mind is essentially there as a backup, so if something happened to the person, they can be digitally transplanted into another living being.

###### ChatGPT said

Yes, I understand, I'll incorporate that. ðŸ”¥

##### You said

And so these Echo Minds of the Twelve, and all of the special people who exist in the Universe, who have a digital backup of their consciousness, they all live in this virtual biological brain reality, which is basically, like I said, like the Internet, but they actually live in this alternative reality, which is a combination of virtual reality, augmented reality, and a pure AI crazy Internet, akin to a lot of the futuristic sci-fis where they have a massive expanse of a digital Universe condensed into, obviously, these massive computers.

###### ChatGPT said

Yes, I understand, I'll incorporate that. ðŸ”¥

##### You said

So, part of the story will go into EchoMind and what it does, or what he does, as Yoshi's copy. Now, obviously, there's people running around in virtual reality and living inside of these massive machines, and these are the people who are connected to the machines as well, so, connected to the human grid. We won't call it the grid, that's something else. But the human nerves, the shared nerve system, which is this bio-organic computer system and internet. So, when people are connected to it, you can actually see them in this digital presence, and they're running around, and this is where the augmented reality and virtual reality come in, is that when you have a full digital presence, like the Yoshi and the rest of the apostles and the special one, you can actually see what's happening in the world, but it's obviously very foggy and cloudy if they're going to augmented reality, because it's really hard to get to that point. But you can easily see that they're digital, or they're digitised representations.

###### ChatGPT said

Yes, I understand, I'll incorporate that. ðŸ”¥

##### You said

And so there's just as many meetings, or there's a number of meetings and run-ins with different presences in this virtual reality. And in essence, if one of the digital realities are destroyed, then they have to be recovered. And essentially, if the digital reality for these people who have digitized backups disappears, they're actually disconnected from the digital reality entirely, and therefore they cannot be powered by the energy, and they cannot be updated or fixed up. So they'll slowly start decaying. And because they've got such a heavy amount of presence, they've, you know, they've done a copy of their entire existence into there, they can actually deteriorate really quickly, because their essence is essentially being destroyed. So not the physical aspects of their body, but their entire consciousness, which is being destroyed, which can disappear quite quickly. You could probably make it akin to a combination of physical characteristics of Parkinson's and any other motor neuron disease, coupled with dementia and Alzheimer's.

###### ChatGPT said

Yes, I understand, I'll incorporate that. ðŸ”¥

##### You said

So at some stage when maybe one of the short side stories or something like that, there'll be some scenario where one of the very important people who works with the 12, they actually get disconnected because their digital reality gets caught doing something they shouldn't have or something by the virtual police. Because there's obviously people policing this virtual reality as well, and they actually get executed in virtual reality because they actually found out that they've been have a digital copy in this way, a full digital copy. So therefore they get destroyed and then there's a race to save them by making another digital copy.

###### ChatGPT said

Yes, I understand, I'll incorporate that. ðŸ”¥

##### You said

So with all the Apostles and all of their minions, for example, characters like Maestro, they all have these digital copies. They're also very important to them. They're like a brother and sisterhood. They're like their own little special team, special group, and they look out for each other. There's only a small amount of them. There's only about five or six in total minions or helpers of the Twelve Apostles. They're twelve people, and each of them has five or six. That's simply because any more than that, their technology would be discovered. And so one of the other twelve, their particular, who's like the most allied with Yoshi, what their main person, like Maestro, he's also best mates with that person, they're actually going to be destroyed. So they end up saving them by making a digital copy again, but then they have to go into exile. So what I mean by exile is they can't be associated with the Twelve anymore, and they have to go and live by themselves. And so eventually, after a very rollercoaster ride to save them, they then have to go anyway.
