          "Develop longer paragraphs for immersive description",
          "Match paragraph length to content type (action vs. description)"
        ],
        "example": "Impact (single sentence): 'Everything changed in that moment.'\nStandard narration (medium): 'Maya navigated through the security protocols with practiced efficiency. Each barrier fell to her specialized software, leaving no trace of her intrusion. The classified files appeared on her display, exactly as their informant had promised.'\nImmersive (longer): 'The abandoned laboratory stretched before them, equipment still arranged as if the scientists had simply stepped away for lunch rather than evacuating during the corporate raid five years earlier. Dust covered the workstations in varying thicknesses, telling a story of air currents and minor leaks in the supposedly sealed environment. Coffee cups had fossilized, their contents transformed into hardened discs of organic material that no longer resembled anything consumable. Someone's family photo remained lodged in a terminal's personalization slot, the smiling faces now faded to pastel ghosts by the constant low-level radiation that permeated the facility.'"
