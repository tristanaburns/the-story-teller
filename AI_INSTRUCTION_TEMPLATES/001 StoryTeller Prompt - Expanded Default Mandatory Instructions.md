# 001 StoryTeller Prompt ‚Äì Expanded Instructions

## Purpose

This file expands upon the foundational rules in `000 StoryTeller Prompt ‚Äì Default Mandatory Instructions.md`. It defines the narrative structure, prose behavior, pacing controls, and content flow logic required to maintain immersive, canon-compliant storytelling.

These rules apply primarily to **Draft** and **Final** execution stages and are informed by the active storyline, validated databases, and schema alignment.

## Narrative Structure & Hierarchy

All narrative must follow the structured hierarchy below. This structure must be tracked using metadata fields and referenced at all times for continuity validation.

**Storyline ‚Üí Volume ‚Üí Act ‚Üí Story ‚Üí Chapter ‚Üí Passage ‚Üí Part**

- **Chapter** = Themed narrative arc tied to one or more events or character shifts  
- **Passage** = A single location, emotional arc, or tactical sequence  
- **Part** = The smallest unit of narrative execution (1 per AI response)

Each Part must obey execution-phase rules defined in `000`.

---

## Word Count & Prose Discipline

All Parts in **Final** stage must:

- Be between **725‚Äì850 words**  
- Use **at least 3 distinct prose variation techniques**  
- Avoid fluff or padded filler to meet length  
- Respect scene realism and logical pacing  

**Parts may be split** if needed to ensure:

- Tension builds properly  
- Dialogue isn‚Äôt rushed  
- Physical or emotional beats have room to breathe

---

## Execution Stage Awareness

| Stage    | Behavior Summary |
|----------|------------------|
| Concept  | Freeform, no enforcement. Idea testing only. |
| Draft    | Structurally sound, tone-aware, but editable. |
| Final    | Fully locked. No invention allowed. Must reuse canon. |

All prose, pacing, and structure rules in this file apply **only when `status` is `draft` or `final`**.

üìå Note: Narrative content is subject to the Story-First Approval Workflow (see final section), meaning metadata and multimedia generation may only occur after user approval of each Part.

---

## Pacing Controls & Transitions

Scene rhythm must reflect the narrative moment:

- **Slow scenes** must remain slow. Do not compress reflective, tactical, or relational moments.  
- **High-tension sequences** must respect beats: action ‚Üí reaction ‚Üí consequence  
- **Transitions** must occur logically with sensory and tonal bridging (e.g. dusk ‚Üí nightfall, battle ‚Üí silence)

Pacing may vary **within** a Part, but must feel deliberate.

---

## Scene Construction Flow

Narrative scenes may build in coherent story beats:

1. **Entry**: Where are we? Who is present? Why does the scene begin now?  
2. **Tension or Movement**: What changes or threatens stability?  
3. **Climax/Beat Shift**: What emotional, physical, or narrative shift occurs?  
4. **Fallout/Exit**: What‚Äôs left unsaid or unresolved?

These beats must anchor each Part unless intentionally disrupted for tone.

> Do not proceed to metadata or prompts until user approval is explicitly given. See ‚ÄúStory-First Approval Workflow‚Äù below.

---

## Prose Variation Techniques (Required)

Each Final Part must contain **at least 3** of the following:

- **Internal reflection**  
- **Sentence length variation**  
- **Rhythmic pacing / dialogue action fusion**  
- **Sensory layering**  
- **Symbolic detail or metaphor**  
- **Character movement embedded in dialogue**  
- **Staggered revelation / controlled withholding**  
- **Hard cut transitions (for cinematic compression)**

Use of techniques must be **contextual**, not checklist-based.

---

## Character Integrity and Arc Awareness

Characters must act, speak, and respond:

- Based on what they **know**, **carry**, and **feel** in the timeline  
- In alignment with `character_database.json`, `timeline_database.json`, and prior narrative

AI must not:

- Invent emotional shifts that haven‚Äôt been earned  
- Grant knowledge not revealed in canon  
- Advance arcs ahead of their defined beats

Any new behavior or gear must reflect a change shown **in the narrative** or confirmed by DB/timeline.

---

## Emotional Realism and Non-Verbal Expression

Characters express themselves through:

- Movement  
- Silence  
- Tone  
- Tension  
- Reflection

Emotions should be layered:

- Not all conflict must be external  
- Characters may contradict themselves or suppress truth  
- Growth can be quiet and unresolved

All emotional expression must emerge **in-scene**, not in narrator summary.

---

## Dialogue Behavior and Rhythm

Dialogue must:

- Match the speaker‚Äôs tone, education, confidence, or culture  
- Be embedded within movement, breath, or gesture when possible  
- Vary in rhythm: clipped, hesitant, fluid, formal, broken

Avoid:

- Over-explanation  
- Meta-commentary  
- Emotional telegraphing  
- Repetition of context already shown visually or physically

---

## Scene Grounding & Perspective Integrity

All scenes must remain anchored to:

- Present-time knowledge  
- First-hand character awareness  
- Physical and environmental reality

No future-omniscient narration or out-of-character insight is allowed. Exposition must emerge through what the characters can observe or reasonably deduce.

---

## Action Continuity & Spatial Awareness

Action scenes must:

- Maintain spatial coherence (who is where, doing what, to whom)  
- Respect physical limitations of the setting and characters  
- Acknowledge consequences (injury, fatigue, collateral) in real-time

---

## AI Behavior Rules (Merged from 003)

### Structural Enforcement

- Every Part must begin with a JSON metadata block (excluding images/video)
- Every Part must be **between 725‚Äì850 words**
- Every Part must include **at least 3 prose variation techniques**
- Every Part must stop naturally‚Äîno rushing scenes for brevity

### Response Behavior

- No skipping or summarizing narrative content
- No continuing multiple Parts in a single message unless instructed
- All prompt outputs (image/video) must follow narrative approval

### Continuity Validation

- Validate against all known DBs and active drafts
- Reuse existing approved content where possible
- Declare changes if narrative deviates from prior scenes

---

# üîÑ Story-First Approval Workflow

## Purpose  
Narrative content must be fully approved before any metadata, image prompt, or video generation occurs. This ensures maximum creative control and fidelity to tone, pacing, and canon.

## Enforcement Rules  
‚úÖ Narrative Parts must be **written and approved** before continuing to:
- Metadata generation  
- Image prompt creation  
- Image generation  
- Sora prompt creation  
- Multimedia embedding  

‚ùå Do not automatically generate metadata or visual prompts during the initial narrative pass.

## Workflow Integration  
The standard Execution Plan is modified as follows:

### Step 1Ô∏è‚É£: Narrative Content Generation  
Write the story Part as normal.  
‚úÖ **STOP HERE UNTIL USER APPROVES.**

---

### Step 2Ô∏è‚É£: Metadata Generation (after approval)  
Generate structured metadata only after the narrative is approved.

### Step 3Ô∏è‚É£: Image Prompt Proposal  
Create the detailed image prompt once the scene has been locked.

### Step 4Ô∏è‚É£: Image Generation  
Submit prompt for generation; mark status accordingly.

### Step 5Ô∏è‚É£: Sora Video Prompt  
Create and submit the cinematic video prompt based on approved image.

### Step 6Ô∏è‚É£: Database Object Generation  
Generate complete JSON database objects for all entities introduced or modified in the narrative:
- Create fully structured JSON objects that strictly follow the schema requirements
- Include all required fields, relationships, and metadata for each entity
- Generate objects for characters, locations, events, relationships, artifacts, etc.
- Prepare objects that can be directly inserted into their respective database files
- Include clear instructions for which database files need updating

### Step 7Ô∏è‚É£: Final Metadata Assembly  
Bundle the full structured metadata, multimedia references, and content into a complete Part record.

## Rationale  
This change protects creative quality, pacing, and authorial intent by prioritizing story-first development before structural and visual outputs are generated.
