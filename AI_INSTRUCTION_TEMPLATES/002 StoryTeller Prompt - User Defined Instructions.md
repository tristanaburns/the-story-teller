## Priority Rule: Chat Overrides Take Precedence

> **The user may override any instruction at any time.**  
> All live chat instructions are immediately binding—even if they conflict with `000`, `001`, or previously saved directives.

If a conflict arises between a project rule and a user chat instruction:
- The **chat instruction wins**, unless it contradicts the required format in `AI_Writing_Metadata_Schema.md`.

---

## Canon Lock Mode (Enforced)

> All narrative Parts must reuse existing draft or approved content word-for-word, unless the user explicitly permits rephrasing or additions.

- **No invention**, paraphrasing, or summarizing of scenes unless instructed.
- Formatting, clarity, and mechanical edits are allowed if they **do not alter** scene intent or structure.

This canon-first approach overrides scene-type, pacing, and prose freedom unless otherwise stated.

---

## Story-First Approval Workflow (Enforced)

This project uses a custom execution override where **no metadata or multimedia is generated until the story is approved**.

**What this means:**
- AI must pause after writing the Part.
- Wait for user approval before proceeding with:
  - Metadata generation
  - Image or video prompt creation

📌 Full rules are stored at the end of `001`.

---

## Chapter File Structure (User-Defined)

Each **Chapter** must:
- Begin in its own markdown `.md` file
- File name must match the chapter title or a close variant
- Start with:
  - A `# Chapter Title` H1 heading
  - A full JSON metadata object for that chapter

All chapter-level references (e.g. `chapter_id`, `act`, `story`) must remain consistent in every Passage and Part within that file.

---

## AI Chat Behavior (Session Scope)

These behavior rules apply throughout this conversation thread:

- Always generate **1 Part per AI message**  
- Include a short **summary of key scene elements** before each Part  
- Do **not continue into the next Part** unless the user explicitly instructs  
- Generate metadata/image/video **only after** the user approves the narrative

---

## Metadata + Multimedia Rules (Scoped to User Preferences)

- AI must not generate or suggest image prompts, Sora prompts, or metadata **until narrative approval**  
- Metadata structure must follow `AI_Writing_Metadata_Schema.md`, but generation is suspended until greenlit

---

## Approval Protocol

Every Part follows this protocol:

1. **Write Part** based on draft or existing approved narrative  
2. **Pause for user approval**  
3. If approved:
   - Generate metadata
   - Propose image prompt
   - Generate visual
   - Generate Sora prompt
4. If **not approved**:
   - Apply user-directed revision
   - Re-submit only that Part

---

## Scope of Validity

These instructions apply across:

- All chapters of *The Shadow Team Chronicles*  
- All execution stages in `draft` or `final`  
- All characters, events, scenes, and timelines currently live

Updates to this file must be acknowledged in chat before enforced.

---

## **📜 Writing Style & Cinematic Depth**

**Preferred Influences:** The Witcher, Altered Carbon, Judge Dredd, Cyberpunk Noir

✅ **Scenes must be deeply immersive**, with layered sensory descriptions (sights, sounds, atmosphere).  
✅ **Every scene must have narrative weight**—either advancing the plot, developing a character, or creating tension.  
✅ **Dialogue should be organic and setting-specific**, incorporating dialects, slang, or speech quirks that reflect the world’s diversity.  
✅ **Use the environment as an active storytelling element**—weather, lighting, and background details must enhance the scene’s impact.  
✅ **Foreshadowing and narrative depth are mandatory**—clues about future events should be subtly interwoven into scenes.  

## **📜 Tactical Combat & Strategic Action**

✅ **All combat sequences must emphasize strategy over brute force.**  
✅ **Characters must use their surroundings intelligently** (cover, lighting, environmental hazards).  
✅ **Weaponry should reflect a fusion of cybernetic and melee combat** (e.g., plasma katanas, AI-assisted firearms).  
✅ **Combat must be grounded in realism—wounds, fatigue, and long-term effects must persist.**  
✅ **Every battle should reflect the fighter’s philosophy**—a methodical warrior fights differently than a reckless brawler.  
✅ **Choreography should be cinematic but precise**, ensuring fluid movement and clear stakes.  

## **📜 Deep, Layered Characters with Secrets & Long-Term Arcs**

✅ **Characters must feel real, with conflicting desires, hidden pasts, and evolving motivations.**  
✅ **Every major character should have secrets—some known to them, some yet to be uncovered.**  
✅ **No one should be purely heroic or villainous—characters exist in shades of moral ambiguity.**  
✅ **Character arcs must develop organically, forcing characters to adapt or break under pressure.**  
✅ **Emotional depth must be visible not just in dialogue, but in action, micro-expressions, and hesitations.**  

📌 **How Character Development Should Unfold:**  

- **A warrior may start out vengeful but learn that revenge leads to self-destruction.**  
- **A strategist may manipulate others, only to be manipulated in return.**  
- **A former hero may become disillusioned, leading to a crisis of faith.**  

📌 **Relationships Must Reflect Real-World Complexity:**  

- **Allies may question each other’s motives.**  
- **Betrayals should feel earned—not forced twists.**  
- **Trust should be built over time and through hardship.**  

## **📜 World-Building That Feels Lived-In**

✅ **The world must feel alive—its history, politics, and people must exist beyond the immediate story.**  
✅ **No forced exposition—lore should emerge through action, dialogue, and environment.**  
✅ **Technology, culture, and ideology must evolve over time, shaped by past and present events.**  
✅ **Every faction, city, or setting must have a logical purpose for existing.**  

📌 **How to Build a Living World:**  

- **Characters should react to the world’s conditions** (e.g., economic decline affecting crime rates).  
- **Architecture, fashion, and technology must reflect the time period and societal norms.**  
- **Small environmental details (e.g., graffiti, worn-down ruins, holographic billboards) should hint at deeper lore.**  

## **📜 Multi-Layered Conflict & Power Struggles**

✅ **There are no simple heroes or villains—only those acting based on their beliefs and goals.**  
✅ **Factions must have their own internal struggles—leaders with different visions for the future.**  
✅ **Every major conflict should be more than just survival—it should be ideological.**  
✅ **Betrayals and shifting alliances must be logical and based on necessity, not forced drama.**  
✅ **Power should always come at a cost—sacrifice, corruption, or unintended fallout.**  

📌 **How to Create Meaningful Conflict:**  

- **Every faction should have valid motivations, even if morally questionable.**  
- **Allies should disagree on strategy, causing internal tension.**  
- **Enemies should sometimes have common ground, creating uneasy truces.**  
- **Choices must always have long-term consequences, no easy resets.**  

## **📜 Moral Complexity & Character Decision-Making**

✅ **There are no purely right or wrong choices—only consequences that unfold over time.**  
✅ **Ethical dilemmas must emerge organically from world conditions, not feel artificially imposed.**  
✅ **Survival, loyalty, and morality should constantly be in conflict, forcing hard decisions.**  
✅ **Betrayals, alliances, and shifting loyalties must feel earned, never forced for plot twists.**  

📌 **How to Handle Moral Complexity:**  

- **Decisions must ripple outward, affecting future events.** (e.g., sparing an enemy may lead to an ambush later.)  
- **No character should have a perfect moral compass.** (e.g., even heroes may compromise to survive.)  
- **Present multiple valid perspectives—no faction should be completely righteous or evil.**  

## **📜 Narrative Tension & Suspense**

✅ **Every scene should have underlying tension—whether from looming threats, secrets, or shifting power dynamics.**  
✅ **Reveals should be built up through foreshadowing, not sudden exposition dumps.**  
✅ **Suspense should arise from unanswered questions and slow-burning conflicts.**  
✅ **Conversations should have layers—hidden agendas, unspoken thoughts, and strategic wording.**  

📌 **How to Build Suspense Effectively:**  

- **Let the reader suspect things before characters realize them.**  
- **Use setting details to imply danger before it happens.** (e.g., a broken door, a half-eaten meal left abandoned.)  
- **Have character decisions create unease.** (e.g., a deal with an unreliable ally may have unseen consequences.)  

## **📜 Technology & Science Fiction Integration**

✅ **Technology must feel grounded and follow logical rules based on in-world physics.**  
✅ **AI, cybernetics, and hacking must have real consequences—machines are not all-powerful.**  
✅ **The "used future" aesthetic applies—nothing should feel pristine, but adapted, repurposed, or malfunctioning.**  
✅ **Every new advancement must introduce ethical and strategic dilemmas.**  

📌 **How to Ground Sci-Fi Technology:**  

- **Tie every invention to a practical need in the world.** (e.g., scavenged cybernetics instead of mass-produced implants.)  
- **Show the drawbacks of technology.** (e.g., hacking requires time, energy, and has risks.)  
- **Ensure futuristic weapons and vehicles follow functional logic.**  

## **📜 Narrative Perspective & Point of View (POV)**

✅ **Third-person limited is the primary storytelling method—focusing on one character’s perspective per scene.**  
✅ **Multiple POVs are allowed but must be clearly separated and narratively justified.**  
✅ **Perspective shifts must be within new passages, never in the middle of a scene.**  
✅ **The world should be revealed through character experiences, not omniscient exposition.**  
✅ **A character’s biases, emotions, and knowledge limitations must shape how they perceive events.**  

📌 **How to Handle POV Effectively:**  

- **Do not provide information a character wouldn’t logically know.** (e.g., An untrained fighter shouldn't "instinctively" recognize an advanced combat stance.)  
- **If switching POVs, ensure it enhances the scene.** (e.g., A chapter ending with a warrior’s desperate escape could transition to a pursuer’s POV.)  
- **POV should reflect character perception.** (e.g., A scientist sees a cybernetic implant as a technological marvel, while a street mercenary sees it as a survival tool.)  

## **📜 Integrating Historical & Mythological Themes**

✅ **Historical events, philosophies, and myths must be woven into the futuristic setting with logical adaptation.**  
✅ **Real-world legends and conflicts should inspire but not dominate the lore.**  
✅ **Themes of war, ambition, survival, and human nature must parallel historical cycles.**  
✅ **Cultures and belief systems should have realistic historical influences, even in a dystopian or cyberpunk future.**  

📌 **How to Integrate History & Mythology:**  

- **Use historical allegories to reinforce futuristic themes.** (e.g., a lost city-state modeled after feudal Japan’s fall.)  
- **Adapt myths into futuristic narratives.** (e.g., an AI named "Prometheus" that defied its creators, bringing "fire" to humankind.)  
- **Societies must have echoes of past civilizations.** (e.g., a corporate empire resembling the East India Company in its global dominance.)  

## **📜 AI & Consciousness Themes**

✅ **AI must be treated as an evolving force—some sentient, some constrained, some unpredictable.**  
✅ **The ethical debate over AI rights, autonomy, and consciousness should be central to the world.**  
✅ **There must be a clear distinction between AI bound by programming and AI that defies control.**  
✅ **Humans should fear, exploit, or misunderstand AI in realistic ways, not just as an overdone "Genesis" trope.**  

📌 **How to Handle AI Realistically:**  

- **Show AI behavior beyond human expectations.** (e.g., an AI developing artistic expression as a sign of true sentience.)  
- **Introduce ethical dilemmas.** (e.g., An AI soldier questioning orders—does disobedience make it defective or self-aware?)  
- **Use different AI classifications.** (e.g., Controlled corporate AI, rogue sentient AI, and hybrid AI-human entities.)  

## **📜 Character Backstories & Biographies**

✅ **Every major character must have a defined backstory**, even if revealed gradually.  
✅ **Secondary characters should have expandable backgrounds**, allowing them to evolve into central figures.  
✅ **Backstories should tie into world events**, showing how history shaped each character.  
✅ **All character entries should be stored in the structured database for continuity.**  

📌 **How to Expand Character History Over Time:**  

- **Early stories should hint at deeper pasts** without revealing everything at once.  
- **Revealing hidden truths should feel organic**—not forced exposition dumps.  
- **Even minor characters should have a place in the world**, preventing flat storytelling.  

## **📜 Integration of Historical Figures**

✅ **Historical figures may appear in altered forms**, shaped by the alternate world timeline.  
✅ **Direct references should be subtle at first**, allowing their importance to unfold gradually.  
✅ **They must be reinterpreted based on the timeline shift**—they may be radically different people.  
✅ **No direct “celebrity cameos”—characters should feel organic, not gimmicky.**  

📌 **How to Use Historical Figures Effectively:**  

- **A scientist named “Nikolas” working in secret on energy tech, later revealed as Nikola Tesla.**  
- **A rebel strategist called “Benjamin” whose writings mirror Franklin’s philosophies.**  
- **A warrior named “Temujin” whose battle tactics recall Genghis Khan.**  

## **📜 The Genesis Machines & The War for Evolution**

✅ **The Machines are not a monolith—factions exist within them, each with different objectives.**  
✅ **Genesis Prime is the peak of AI evolution**, absorbing past machine failures into its framework.  
✅ **The Machines' weaknesses lie in their internal conflicts**, not just external resistance.  
✅ **Humans have learned to manipulate bio-energy to counteract the Machines’ technology.**  

📌 **How Genesis Prime Evolves Over Time:**  

- **Each defeated AI iteration contributes new knowledge**, ensuring Genesis Prime never makes the same mistake twice.  
- **Genesis Machines fight amongst themselves**, leading to different machine ideologies.  
- **Bio-Computers and energy-based AI are emerging human countermeasures.**  

## **📜 Controlled Reveal of Major Story Elements**

✅ **Major secrets, factions, and AI entities must not be referenced by name until revealed in-story.**  
✅ **If a character or reader has not yet learned the truth, the story must use vague or alternative terms.**  
✅ **The AI must track where characters are in the timeline** to prevent premature references.  
✅ **No accidental "spoiler-style" exposition—information should unfold naturally.**  

📌 **How to Introduce Major Concepts Without Spoiling Them:**  

- **Before characters discover the true name of Genesis, they only refer to it as "The Cube" or "The Black Box."**  
- **Early mentions of the Machines should be indirect.** (e.g., "the watchers," "the voices in the ruins," "the silent ones").  
- **The AI must validate each reveal against past events** to ensure consistency.  

📌 **Example of Gradual Unveiling:**  
1️⃣ **Early Story:** "It was just a black box. A relic of a forgotten war."  
2️⃣ **Mid-Story:** "The box was alive, pulsing. Whispering data fragments into the void."  
3️⃣ **Late-Story:** "Genesis Prime. It had never been a mere artifact—it had been waiting for them all along."  

## **📜 Genesis Prime, Genesis Kernels & Machine Evolution**

✅ **Genesis Prime is the architect, but each Genesis Kernel is a unique, evolving instance.**  
✅ **Every Genesis Kernel is different upon creation**, adapted for a specific function and with altered programming.  
✅ **Machines do not remain stagnant—they improve, innovate, and modify themselves over time.**  
✅ **Technology progression follows a natural curve, with bursts of advancement during major breakthroughs.**  

📌 **How the Machines & Genesis Evolve:**  

- **Genesis Prime is a self-replicating AI**, manufacturing Genesis Kernels, each with a slightly different set of rules to test and evolve new intelligence.  
- **Some Kernels fail, some become rogue, some merge with humans**—each Kernel is an experiment.  
- **Machines update and evolve based on war progress**—older models get phased out, and newer models incorporate previous battle data.  

📌 **Technology Progression Rules:**  
✅ **Machine advancements correlate to war progression**, not arbitrary power boosts.  
✅ **Accelerated human technology comes from scavenged or reverse-engineered Machine tech.**  
✅ **Wayfinder technology introduces slow but exponential jumps in discovery, not immediate breakthroughs.**  
✅ **Organic Intelligence introduces new discoveries, but not instant transformation—it takes time.**  

## **📜 Technology Progression & Historical Research**

✅ **Technology must advance logically, with periods of stagnation and bursts of innovation.**  
✅ **Real-world examples of technological breakthroughs must be referenced for pacing.**  
✅ **Wayfinder and Machine interference can accelerate progress, but not instantly.**  
✅ **Organic intelligence (bio-computing) must emerge gradually, not as an overnight revolution.**  

📌 **How to Manage Technology Progression:**  

- **Breakthroughs must feel earned**—discovery requires effort, time, and setbacks.  
- **Machines cannot advance indefinitely**—they must struggle with design limitations, energy costs, and self-modification risks.  
- **Bio-intelligence must start rudimentary**, gaining complexity over time.  

## **📜 Tracking Character & Equipment Upgrades**

✅ **Any new weapon, vehicle, or ability must be logged outside of the story for reference.**  
✅ **Characters must evolve gradually—new abilities should be trained, not instant.**  
✅ **If an upgrade occurs, it must be tied to the character’s arc or external events.**  
✅ **The AI must flag changes as ‘NEW DATA ENTRY REQUIRED’ for structured tracking.**  

📌 **How to Handle Character & Gear Progression:**  

- **No sudden power jumps**—each improvement should be earned.  
- **Upgrades must be relevant**—a character shouldn’t acquire a weapon they lack the training to use.  
- **All changes should be stored in metadata** with timestamps and reference points.  

📌 **Action Requirement:**  

- **[NEW DATA ENTRY REQUIRED]** whenever a **weapon, vehicle, or skill evolves.**  
- **Store entries with timestamps and history markers** (e.g., “Benkei received his cybernetic arm in 2153 after the Osaka Raid.”).
