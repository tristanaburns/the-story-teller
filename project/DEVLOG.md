## 2025-04-20 - [Dependency] Update Dependencies to Latest Versions

**Author:** Project Team

### Changes Made
- Updated all dependencies to their latest versions in `package.json`:
  - Next.js: 15.3.1
  - React/React DOM: 19.1.0
  - TypeScript: 5.8.3
  - NextAuth.js: 4.24.11
  - MongoDB: 6.15.0
  - Mongoose: 8.13.2
  - TailwindCSS: 4.1.4
  - PostCSS: 8.5.3
  - ESLint: 9.25.0
  - Marked: 15.0.8
  - MongoDB Adapter: 3.9.0
- Updated initialization scripts to use specific versions:
  - Enhanced PowerShell script (`init-project.ps1`)
  - Created Bash script (`init-project.sh`) for Unix/Linux systems
- Added development dependencies:
  - Jest: 29.7.0
  - React Testing Library: 15.0.0
  - Playwright: 1.42.1
  - TypeScript utilities for testing
- Added DEVLOG instructions document with detailed guidelines for maintaining the development log

### Decisions
- **Decision:** Pin exact versions of dependencies rather than using semver ranges.
  **Rationale:** Ensures consistent behavior across all development and production environments.

- **Decision:** Add both Windows and Unix initialization scripts.
  **Rationale:** Provides better support for diverse development environments and ensures consistent setup regardless of operating system.

### Challenges
- Some packages have interdependencies that require specific version combinations
- Finding the correct version of TailwindCSS to work with the latest Next.js version
- Ensuring cross-platform compatibility for initialization scripts

### Next Steps
1. Initialize Next.js application using the updated initialization scripts
2. Configure MongoDB Atlas connection
3. Set up authentication with NextAuth.js
4. Create initial application layout and routing structure

## 2025-04-20 - [Setup] Project Documentation and Structure

**Author:** Project Team

### Changes Made
- Created project documentation structure:
  - `project-requirements.md`: Detailed functional and non-functional requirements
  - `project-plan.md`: Development roadmap and timeline
  - `project-structure.md`: Technical structure and architecture
  - `service-deployment-guide.md`: Deployment instructions
  - `test-implementation-plan.md`: Testing strategy and examples
  - `DEVLOG.md`: This development log
  - `README.md`: Project overview and setup instructions
- Created `/project` directory to organize documentation
- Established initial Next.js application structure
- Created PowerShell initialization script

### Decisions

#### Authentication Approach
**Decision:** Use NextAuth.js with Google and GitHub OAuth providers.

**Rationale:**
- Simplifies OAuth integration
- Provides session management
- Handles token rotation
- Supports multiple providers
- Well-maintained library with good documentation

#### Database Architecture
**Decision:** Each user gets their own MongoDB database with collections for stories, characters, locations, etc.

**Rationale:**
- Clear separation of user data
- Better scalability for individual users
- Simplified access control
- Potentially better performance for user-specific queries
- Easier to implement per-user backup and restore

#### State Management
**Decision:** Use React Context API and SWR for data fetching instead of Redux.

**Rationale:**
- Simpler implementation for our use case
- Built-in caching and revalidation with SWR
- Reduced boilerplate code
- Better performance for our specific application structure
- Easier to understand for new developers

#### Deployment Platform
**Decision:** Deploy on Vercel with MongoDB Atlas.

**Rationale:**
- Optimized for Next.js applications
- Simplified deployment workflow
- Global CDN with edge functions
- Good integration with GitHub
- Easy environment configuration
- Automatic SSL certificates

### Challenges
- Determining optimal project structure that integrates with existing files
- Designing database architecture for user-specific MongoDB databases
- Establishing secure API for OpenAI Custom GPT integration
- Managing schema compatibility between existing JSON schemas and MongoDB

### Next Steps
1. Initialize the Next.js application
2. Implement authentication with NextAuth.js
3. Set up MongoDB Atlas connection
4. Create user-specific database provisioning
5. Implement story management API
6. Develop dashboard UI
7. Create AI integration API endpoint
