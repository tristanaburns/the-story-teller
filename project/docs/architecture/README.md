# Architecture Documentation

*Last Updated: 2025-04-22*

This directory contains architecture documentation for The Story Teller project, detailing the system design, component relationships, and architectural decisions.

## Purpose

The architecture documentation provides a high-level overview of The Story Teller system design, explaining the relationships between components, data flows, and design patterns used throughout the application.

## Contents

This directory contains:

- **Architecture Overview**: High-level description of the system architecture
- **Component Architecture**: Details of major system components
- **Data Flow Diagrams**: Visualizations of data movement through the system
- **Technology Stack**: Documentation of technology choices
- **Design Patterns**: Architectural patterns used in the implementation
- **Security Architecture**: Security design and implementation
- **Integration Points**: External system integrations

## Key Documents

- [**Project Architecture Overview**](./project-architecture-overview.md): Comprehensive system architecture description

## Architectural Principles

The Story Teller architecture follows these core principles:

1. **Modularity**: System composed of loosely coupled, highly cohesive modules
2. **Scalability**: Design that allows for growth in users and features
3. **Maintainability**: Easy-to-understand and modify structure
4. **Security**: Security by design throughout the architecture
5. **Performance**: Optimized for responsive user experience
6. **Testability**: Architecture that facilitates comprehensive testing
7. **Accessibility**: Design that supports accessible implementation

## Architecture Views

The architecture is documented through multiple views:

1. **Logical View**: Conceptual components and their relationships
2. **Process View**: Runtime behavior and data flows
3. **Development View**: Code organization and module structure
4. **Physical View**: Deployment and infrastructure
5. **Scenarios**: How the architecture supports key use cases

## Architecture Decision Records

Important architectural decisions are documented with:

1. **Context**: Situation requiring a decision
2. **Options**: Alternatives that were considered
3. **Decision**: The chosen approach and justification
4. **Consequences**: Resulting impacts, both positive and negative
5. **Status**: Current status of the decision

## Using This Documentation

This architecture documentation should be used by:

- **Developers**: To understand system design and relationships
- **Technical Leads**: For architectural governance and consistency
- **New Team Members**: For onboarding and system understanding
- **System Administrators**: To understand deployment architecture
- **External Integrators**: To understand integration points

## Document Maintenance

Architecture documentation should be updated:

- When architectural decisions change
- When new components are added
- When component relationships change
- When technology choices evolve
- After architecture reviews and assessments
