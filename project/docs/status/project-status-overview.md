# The Story Teller: Implementation Status Overview

*Last Updated: 2025-04-29*

## Current Status Summary

The Story Teller project is now focused on implementing the Minimum Testable Product (MTP) as defined in the Blueprint v2. We have completed the MCP server integration and comprehensive logging system, and now we're prioritizing the core components needed for the MTP: Schema IDE & Passage Editor with AI generation capabilities, schema enforcement, and database isolation.

   - ✅ Implemented per-user MongoDB databases
   - ✅ Created Ajv validation middleware
   - ✅ Set up schema validation for all API endpoints
   - ✅ Built error responses for invalid API calls
   - 🔄 Optimizing performance and error handling

3. **Epic E2: Importer & Seed**
   - Developing CLI seed functionality
   - Creating Shadow Team Chronicles sample data
   - Implementing first-login detection and seeding

## Known Issues and Challenges

- AI generation requires robust error handling
- Per-user databases need careful access control implementation
- Schema validation must be consistent across all endpoints
- Sample data seeding needs to cover all required data types
- Editor skeleton must support the core MTP functionality
