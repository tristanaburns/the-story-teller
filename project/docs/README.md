# The Story Teller: Documentation

This directory contains the comprehensive documentation for The Story Teller project. The documentation is organized into logical sections to make it easier to maintain and update.

## Documentation Structure

The documentation is organized into the following directories:

- **plan/**: Project planning documents, implementation phases, and roadmaps
- **structure/**: Project structure documentation, directory layouts, and component organization
- **architecture/**: Technical architecture documentation, including frontend, backend, and database designs
- **status/**: Implementation status tracking, covering completed, in-progress, and planned features

## File Naming Convention

All documentation files follow a consistent naming convention:

- **project-plan-\*.md**: Files related to project planning
- **project-structure-\*.md**: Files related to project structure
- **project-architecture-\*.md**: Files related to technical architecture
- **project-status-\*.md**: Files related to implementation status

## Documentation Access

The primary entry point to the documentation is the `index.md` file in this directory, which provides a comprehensive overview of all documentation files and their purposes.

## Updating Documentation

When updating documentation:

1. **Follow Existing Conventions**: Maintain consistent formats and naming conventions
2. **Update Related Files**: If updating status information, ensure corresponding files are updated
3. **Preserve Unimplemented Plans**: Never delete unimplemented items from planning documents
4. **Include Last Updated Date**: Add or update the "Last Updated" timestamp at the top of edited files
5. **Cross-Reference**: Use relative links to reference related documentation files

## Documentation Integrity Guidelines

1. **Never Delete Unimplemented Items**: Plan items that have not yet been implemented must NEVER be deleted.
2. **Limited-Scope Updates**: Only update sections directly related to your specific changes.
3. **Preserve Project Roadmap**: The full project roadmap must be maintained regardless of implementation status.
4. **Maintain Historical Context**: Previous planning decisions must be preserved for reference and continuity.
5. **Incremental Updates Only**: Add new information incrementally rather than replacing existing content.

These guidelines ensure that the documentation serves as both a current reference and a historical record of the project's evolution.
