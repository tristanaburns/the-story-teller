# The Story Teller: Structure Documentation

This directory contains documentation about the project's codebase structure, organization, and conventions. These documents help navigate the repository and understand the organization of code.

## Available Documents

- **directory-structure.md**: Overall organization of project directories
- **code-organization.md**: Patterns and conventions for code organization
- **file-naming-conventions.md**: Naming standards for various file types
- **module-structure.md**: Organization of functional modules within the system

## How to Use These Documents

- **For Project Navigation**: Consult `directory-structure.md` to understand the overall project layout
- **For Code Standards**: Review `code-organization.md` for implementation patterns
- **For Naming Conventions**: Reference `file-naming-conventions.md` for consistent naming
- **For Module Understanding**: Use `module-structure.md` to understand component organization

## Structure Categories

The structure documentation covers these key areas:

1. **Repository Organization**: Directory structure and file locations
2. **Component Structure**: Organization of UI components
3. **API Structure**: Layout of API endpoints and services
4. **Configuration Structure**: Organization of application configuration
5. **Asset Organization**: Management of static assets and resources
6. **Test Structure**: Organization of test files and fixtures

## Updating Structure Documentation

When updating these documents:

1. **Real-Time Updates**: Update structure documentation when making significant structural changes
2. **Directory Maps**: Keep directory tree visualizations up to date
3. **Standard Enforcement**: Note any exceptions to documented standards
4. **Cross-Reference**: Ensure structure documents align with architecture documentation
5. **Migration Notes**: Document the process for structural migrations or reorganizations

## Importance of Structure Documentation

Well-maintained structure documentation provides:

- Clear navigation guidance for developers
- Consistency in project organization
- Reduced onboarding time for new team members
- Improved efficiency in locating and modifying code
- Foundation for scaling the codebase

## Relation to Other Documentation

Structure documentation connects closely to:

- **Architecture Documentation**: For understanding how code structure implements architecture
- **Development Guidelines**: For connecting structure to development standards
- **Build Documentation**: For explaining how structure affects build processes

## Structure Evolution

The structure documents should evolve through:

1. Initial project scaffolding documentation
2. Regular updates as the codebase grows
3. Refactoring documentation when reorganizing code
4. Addition of new structural patterns as needed
5. Deprecation notices for outdated structural approaches
