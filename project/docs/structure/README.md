# Structure

*Last Updated: 2025-04-22*

This directory contains documentation about the structure and organization of The Story Teller project, including code organization, file naming conventions, and module structure.

## Purpose

The structure documentation provides developers with comprehensive information about how the project is organized, ensuring consistency in code organization and helping new team members navigate the codebase efficiently.

## Contents

This directory contains:

- **Code Organization**: Documentation of code organization patterns and principles
- **File Naming Conventions**: Standards for naming files and directories
- **Module Structure**: Explanation of module design and organization
- **Directory Structure**: Overview of project directories and their purposes

## Key Documents

- [**Project Structure Code Organization**](./project-structure-code-organization.md): Code organization principles and patterns
- [**Project Structure File Naming Conventions**](./project-structure-file-naming-conventions.md): Standards for file and directory naming
- [**Project Structure Module Structure**](./project-structure-module-structure.md): Module design and interaction documentation

## Structural Principles

The Story Teller project follows these structural principles:

1. **Modularity**: Code is organized into distinct, loosely coupled modules
2. **Feature-Based Structure**: Components are grouped by feature rather than type
3. **Clear Responsibilities**: Each file and function has a single responsibility
4. **Consistent Patterns**: Similar problems are solved in similar ways
5. **Hierarchical Organization**: Project structure follows a logical hierarchy

## Using This Documentation

This documentation serves as a reference for maintaining structural consistency within the project. When adding new code:

1. Review the relevant structural documentation
2. Follow established patterns and conventions
3. Organize new code according to existing principles
4. Update documentation if new structural patterns are introduced

## Document Maintenance

Structure documentation should be updated:

- When new structural patterns are introduced
- When existing patterns are modified
- When file organization changes
- When module responsibilities change
- As part of onboarding materials preparation

## Related Documentation

- **Architecture Documentation**: For high-level system design information
- **Coding Guidelines**: For standards on code style within files
- **Folder Structure**: For detailed directory organization reference
- **Development Workflow**: For information on the development process

# The Story Teller: Structure Documentation

This directory contains documentation about the project's codebase structure, organization, and conventions. These documents help navigate the repository and understand the organization of code.

## Available Documents

- **directory-structure.md**: Overall organization of project directories
- **code-organization.md**: Patterns and conventions for code organization
- **file-naming-conventions.md**: Naming standards for various file types
- **module-structure.md**: Organization of functional modules within the system

## How to Use These Documents

- **For Project Navigation**: Consult `directory-structure.md` to understand the overall project layout
- **For Code Standards**: Review `code-organization.md` for implementation patterns
- **For Naming Conventions**: Reference `file-naming-conventions.md` for consistent naming
- **For Module Understanding**: Use `module-structure.md` to understand component organization

## Structure Categories

The structure documentation covers these key areas:

1. **Repository Organization**: Directory structure and file locations
2. **Component Structure**: Organization of UI components
3. **API Structure**: Layout of API endpoints and services
4. **Configuration Structure**: Organization of application configuration
5. **Asset Organization**: Management of static assets and resources
6. **Test Structure**: Organization of test files and fixtures

## Updating Structure Documentation

When updating these documents:

1. **Real-Time Updates**: Update structure documentation when making significant structural changes
2. **Directory Maps**: Keep directory tree visualizations up to date
3. **Standard Enforcement**: Note any exceptions to documented standards
4. **Cross-Reference**: Ensure structure documents align with architecture documentation
5. **Migration Notes**: Document the process for structural migrations or reorganizations

## Importance of Structure Documentation

Well-maintained structure documentation provides:

- Clear navigation guidance for developers
- Consistency in project organization
- Reduced onboarding time for new team members
- Improved efficiency in locating and modifying code
- Foundation for scaling the codebase

## Relation to Other Documentation

Structure documentation connects closely to:

- **Architecture Documentation**: For understanding how code structure implements architecture
- **Development Guidelines**: For connecting structure to development standards
- **Build Documentation**: For explaining how structure affects build processes

## Structure Evolution

The structure documents should evolve through:

1. Initial project scaffolding documentation
2. Regular updates as the codebase grows
3. Refactoring documentation when reorganizing code
4. Addition of new structural patterns as needed
5. Deprecation notices for outdated structural approaches
