# Structure

*Last Updated: 2025-04-22*

This directory contains documentation about the structure and organization of The Story Teller project, including code organization, file naming conventions, and module structure.

## Purpose

The structure documentation provides developers with comprehensive information about how the project is organized, ensuring consistency in code organization and helping new team members navigate the codebase efficiently.

## Contents

This directory contains:

- **Code Organization**: Documentation of code organization patterns and principles
- **File Naming Conventions**: Standards for naming files and directories
- **Module Structure**: Explanation of module design and organization
- **Directory Structure**: Overview of project directories and their purposes

## Key Documents

- [**Project Structure Code Organization**](./project-structure-code-organization.md): Code organization principles and patterns
- [**Project Structure File Naming Conventions**](./project-structure-file-naming-conventions.md): Standards for file and directory naming
- [**Project Structure Module Structure**](./project-structure-module-structure.md): Module design and interaction documentation

## Structural Principles

The Story Teller project follows these structural principles:

1. **Modularity**: Code is organized into distinct, loosely coupled modules
2. **Feature-Based Structure**: Components are grouped by feature rather than type
3. **Clear Responsibilities**: Each file and function has a single responsibility
4. **Consistent Patterns**: Similar problems are solved in similar ways
5. **Hierarchical Organization**: Project structure follows a logical hierarchy

## Using This Documentation

This documentation serves as a reference for maintaining structural consistency within the project. When adding new code:

1. Review the relevant structural documentation
2. Follow established patterns and conventions
3. Organize new code according to existing principles
4. Update documentation if new structural patterns are introduced

## Document Maintenance

Structure documentation should be updated:

- When new structural patterns are introduced
- When existing patterns are modified
- When file organization changes
- When module responsibilities change
- As part of onboarding materials preparation
