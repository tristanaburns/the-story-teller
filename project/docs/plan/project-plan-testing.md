# The Story Teller: Testing Philosophy

*Last Updated: 2025-04-22*

## Testing Philosophy

Each module, feature, and component will undergo thorough testing before moving to the next implementation phase. Our testing approach includes:

1. **Unit Testing**: Testing individual functions and API endpoints (100% code coverage required)
2. **Integration Testing**: Testing interactions between components, especially AI integration (100% code coverage required)
3. **End-to-End Testing**: Testing complete user workflows for story creation and management (100% code coverage required)
4. **Performance Testing**: Testing application responsiveness with large narrative databases
5. **Security Testing**: Validating authentication, authorization, and data security
6. **Cross-Browser Testing**: Ensuring compatibility across major browsers
7. **MCP Server Testing**: Validating NestJS MCP server functionality and integration (100% code coverage required)
8. **Logging Testing**: Verifying correct functionality of the logging system across all components (100% code coverage required)

There will be absolutely no exceptions to the 100% test coverage requirement. All code must be fully tested before being considered complete. This strict testing policy ensures maximum system stability, prevents cascading issues, and maintains the highest quality standards. Only after a component passes its complete test suite will we proceed to the next implementation phase.

## Testing Tools & Frameworks

- **API Testing**: Jest, Supertest (100% coverage required)
- **UI Testing**: React Testing Library, Jest (100% coverage required)
- **E2E Testing**: Playwright (100% coverage required)
- **Performance Testing**: Lighthouse, WebPageTest
- **Database Testing**: MongoDB Memory Server (100% coverage required)
- **MCP Server Testing**: Jest, Supertest (100% coverage required)
- **NestJS Testing**: Jest, NestJS Testing Module (100% coverage required)
- **Logging Testing**: Winston test helpers, Mock logger (100% coverage required)

Each test run must report 100% coverage across all metrics (statements, branches, functions, and lines). Any code that falls below 100% coverage will be rejected from the codebase until proper tests are implemented. This strict requirement applies to all components without exception.

## Test Milestones

The project plan defines a series of test milestones that correspond to specific implementation phases. Each milestone must be successfully completed before proceeding to the next implementation phase.

For a detailed breakdown of test milestones, refer to the [Implementation Phases](./phases.md) document.

## Continuous Integration

The project uses continuous integration to ensure that tests are run automatically on each code change:

1. **Pull Request Checks**: Tests are run automatically on each pull request
2. **Coverage Reports**: Coverage reports are generated and must show 100% coverage
3. **Main Branch Protection**: The main branch is protected and requires passing tests
4. **Deployment Approval**: Deployments require passing tests
