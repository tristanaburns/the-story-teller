# The Story Teller: Project Planning Documentation

This directory contains the project planning documentation for The Story Teller. These documents outline the project's goals, implementation phases, testing philosophy, and roadmap.

## Documentation Integrity Guidelines

**MANDATORY**: All planning documentation is subject to strict documentation integrity requirements:

1. **Never Delete Unimplemented Items**: Plan items that have not yet been implemented must NEVER be deleted from these documents.
2. **Limited-Scope Updates**: Only update sections directly related to your specific changes.
3. **Preserve Project Roadmap**: The full project roadmap must be maintained regardless of implementation status.
4. **Maintain Historical Context**: Previous planning decisions must be preserved for reference and continuity.
5. **Incremental Updates Only**: Add new information incrementally rather than replacing existing content.

These requirements ensure that the project plan remains a comprehensive roadmap and historical record. Removing planned but unimplemented features from documentation is strictly prohibited as it compromises project integrity.

## Available Documents

- **project-plan-overview.md**: High-level project overview and guiding principles
- **project-plan-milestones.md**: Key project milestones with expected completion dates
- **project-plan-phases.md**: Detailed breakdown of implementation phases and tasks
- **project-plan-testing.md**: Testing philosophy, approach, and requirements
- **project-plan-extensions.md**: Ideas for future extensions and enhancements

## How to Use These Documents

## Updating Planning Documents

When updating these documents:

1. **Preserve Unimplemented Items**: Never delete items that haven't been implemented yet
2. **Mark Completed Items**: Use ‚úÖ to mark completed items
3. **Mark In-Progress Items**: Use üîÑ to mark items currently in development
4. **Mark Planned Items**: Use ‚è±Ô∏è to mark items planned for future development

6. **Cross-Reference**: Use relative links to reference related documents

## Importance of Documentation Integrity

These planning documents serve not only as a guide for current development but also as a historical record of the project's evolution. Maintaining the integrity of these documents, particularly by preserving unimplemented items, is critical for understanding the full scope of the project's vision.

## Relation to Other Documentation

The planning documents relate to other documentation sections:

- **Status Documentation**: For the current implementation status of planned features
- **Structure Documentation**: For understanding how the planned components are organized
