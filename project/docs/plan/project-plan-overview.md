# The Story Teller: Project Overview

*Last Updated: 2025-04-22*

## Project Overview

**Project Name:** The Story Teller  
**Architecture:** Next.js application with MongoDB Atlas, NestJS MCP servers, and AI integration  
**Primary Technology:** TypeScript, Next.js, NestJS, MongoDB, Model Context Protocol  
**Secondary Technology:** OpenAI API, D3.js, Tailwind CSS  

The Story Teller is an advanced schema-driven framework designed to create rich, consistent narrative content with AI assistance. It combines structured metadata, standardized writing patterns, comprehensive documentation, and specialized MCP servers to enable the creation of complex, interconnected stories while maintaining continuity and quality.

## Guiding Principles

1. **Schema-Driven Development**: Create and maintain formal schemas for all narrative elements
2. **Data Integrity**: Ensure relationships between narrative elements are maintained
3. **User Experience First**: Design intuitive interfaces for complex operations
4. **AI Augmentation**: Use AI to assist creativity, not replace it
5. **Consistent Documentation**: Maintain comprehensive documentation at all levels
6. **Modular Architecture**: Create loosely coupled components for future extensibility
7. **Performance Optimization**: Ensure responsive experience even with large datasets
8. **MCP Integration**: Leverage specialized NestJS-based MCP servers for enhanced functionality
9. **Observability**: Maintain comprehensive logging across all components for debugging, monitoring, and analysis
10. **Complete Test Coverage**: Maintain 100% test coverage across all code with no exceptions

## Cross-Cutting Concerns

The project addresses several cross-cutting concerns that apply to all components:

1. **Logging and Observability**
2. **Security Implementation**
3. **API Documentation Standards**

For detailed information on these cross-cutting concerns, see the separate documents in the architecture section.
