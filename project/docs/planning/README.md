This directory contains planning documents for The Story Teller project, outlining the project roadmap, milestones, and development strategies.

## Purpose

The planning directory serves as a repository for strategic project planning documents, providing a centralized location for timeline planning, feature prioritization, and resource allocation documentation.

## Contents

This directory contains:

- **Project Roadmap**: High-level timeline of planned features and releases
- **Sprint Planning**: Documentation of sprint goals and task breakdowns
- **Feature Specifications**: Detailed specifications for planned features
- **Release Planning**: Schedule and details for product releases
- **Resource Allocation**: Documentation of team assignments and resource management
- **Project Extensions**: Plans for future enhancements and additional features

## Key Documents

- [**Project Roadmap**](./project-roadmap.md): Development timeline and milestone overview
- [**Feature Specifications**](./project-feature-specifications.md): Detailed feature descriptions
- [**Sprint Planning**](./project-sprint-planning.md): Current and future sprint details
- [**Release Planning**](./project-release-planning.md): Release schedules and processes
- [**Resource Allocation**](./project-resource-allocation.md): Team structure and assignments

## Planning Process

The Story Teller project follows these planning principles:

1. **Strategic Planning**: Quarterly review of project direction and goals
2. **Release Planning**: Monthly planning for upcoming releases
3. **Sprint Planning**: Bi-weekly planning sessions for development sprints
4. **Backlog Refinement**: Weekly refinement of project backlog
5. **Daily Coordination**: Daily standups to track progress and address blockers

## Document Maintenance

Planning documents should be updated:

- At the completion of significant milestones
- When project scope or direction changes
- Before each major release planning session
- After strategic planning meetings
- When resource allocation changes

## Using These Documents

These planning documents should be used by:

- **Project Managers**: For tracking progress and planning
- **Development Team**: For understanding priorities and timelines
- **Stakeholders**: For visibility into project status and roadmap
- **New Team Members**: For understanding project direction and context

## Related Documentation

- **Status Documentation**: For current implementation status against plans
- **Project Architecture**: For understanding how planning relates to technical implementation
- **Team Workflow**: For information on the development process
- **Project Guidelines**: For standards and best practices
