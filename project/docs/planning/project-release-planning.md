## Versioning Strategy

The project uses Semantic Versioning (SemVer) with the format: MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH

- **MAJOR**: Incompatible API changes or significant feature additions
- **MINOR**: Backward-compatible feature additions
- **PATCH**: Backward-compatible bug fixes

### Version Naming Guidelines

- **Alpha Releases**: v0.x.0 (x < 5)
- **Beta Releases**: v0.x.0 (x ‚â• 5)
- **General Availability**: v1.0.0 and above
- **Feature Updates**: Increment MINOR version
- **Bug Fix Releases**: Increment PATCH version
- **Major Platform Updates**: Increment MAJOR version

## Release Contents

Each release includes:

1. **Features**: New capabilities and enhancements
2. **Bug Fixes**: Corrections to known issues
3. **Performance Improvements**: Optimizations and efficiency enhancements
4. **Security Updates**: Security-related fixes and improvements
5. **Documentation Updates**: User and technical documentation revisions

## Release Criteria

Before a release is approved, it must meet these criteria:

### Alpha Release Criteria

2. **Release Branch Creation**: Create branch from main
3. **Version Bump**: Update version numbers
4. **Release Candidate Building**: Create release candidate builds
5. **Release Notes Preparation**: Document features and changes

### Testing Phase

1. **Regression Testing**: Verify existing functionality
2. **Feature Testing**: Validate new capabilities
3. **Integration Testing**: Ensure system components work together
4. **Performance Testing**: Validate performance metrics
5. **Security Testing**: Check for vulnerabilities
6. **User Acceptance Testing**: Validate against user requirements

### Deployment Phase

1. **Final Build Creation**: Create production build
2. **Staged Deployment**: Deploy to staging environment
3. **Smoke Testing**: Verify basic functionality in staging
4. **Production Deployment**: Phased rollout to production
5. **Post-Deployment Verification**: Confirm successful deployment
6. **Monitoring**: Track performance and issues

### Post-Release Phase

1. **Release Announcement**: Notify users and stakeholders
2. **Documentation Publishing**: Update all documentation
3. **Support Readiness**: Prepare support team
4. **Feedback Collection**: Gather user feedback

| Staging | Pre-production verification | Internal Team | Per release |
| Production | Live application | Public | Per release schedule |

## Deployment Strategy

The production deployment follows these strategies:

1. **Staged Rollout**: Gradual user base expansion
2. **Blue-Green Deployment**: Parallel environments for zero downtime
3. **Feature Flags**: Control feature availability
4. **Canary Releases**: Test with subset of users
5. **Automated Rollback**: Quick recovery from issues

## Rollback Procedures

In case of deployment issues, the rollback process is:

1. **Issue Identification**: Determine severity and impact
2. **Decision Making**: Assess whether rollback is necessary
