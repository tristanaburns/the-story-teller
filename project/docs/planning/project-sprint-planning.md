# The Story Teller: Sprint Planning

*Last Updated: 2025-04-22*

This document outlines the sprint planning process and current sprint details for The Story Teller project. It provides guidance on sprint organization, task breakdown, and progress tracking.

## Sprint Methodology

The Story Teller project follows a modified Agile methodology with:

- **Sprint Duration**: 2 weeks
- **Planning Meetings**: Beginning of each sprint
- **Daily Standups**: 15-minute check-ins each morning
- **Sprint Reviews**: End of each sprint to demonstrate completed work
- **Retrospectives**: End of each sprint to identify improvements
- **Backlog Refinement**: Mid-sprint to prepare for upcoming sprints

## Current Sprint: Sprint 8 (April 15 - April 29, 2025)

### Sprint Goals

1. Complete core story editor functionality
2. Begin implementation of character management system
3. Resolve critical bugs from previous sprint

## Sprint Backlog Management

The project backlog is managed according to these principles:

1. **Prioritization**: Items are prioritized based on business value, technical dependencies, and risk
2. **Story Points**: Complexity is estimated using story points (Fibonacci: 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13)
3. **Definition of Ready**: Backlog items must have clear acceptance criteria and be properly sized
4. **Task Breakdown**: Large items are broken down into manageable tasks under 8 points
5. **Buffer**: Each sprint includes 20% capacity buffer for unexpected issues

## Sprint Planning Process

The sprint planning meeting follows this agenda:

1. **Review Project Roadmap**: Confirm alignment with overall project goals
2. **Discuss Sprint Goals**: Agree on primary objectives for the sprint
3. **Capacity Planning**: Determine available team capacity
4. **Backlog Selection**: Choose items from the backlog based on priority and capacity
5. **Task Breakdown**: Break down selected items into specific tasks
6. **Assignment**: Assign tasks to team members
7. **Commitment**: Team commits to the sprint backlog

## Sprint Review Process

At the end of each sprint, the team conducts a review following this format:

1. **Demo**: Demonstration of completed features
2. **Progress Update**: Review of sprint goals achievement
3. **Metrics Review**: Velocity, completion rate, and quality metrics
4. **Stakeholder Feedback**: Collection of feedback on demonstrated features
5. **Backlog Impact**: Discussion of any changes needed to the backlog

## Sprint Retrospective Process

The retrospective follows this format:

1. **What Went Well**: Positive aspects to continue
2. **What Could Be Improved**: Areas for enhancement
3. **Action Items**: Specific improvements to implement
4. **Previous Action Review**: Follow-up on previous retrospective actions

## Sprint Artifacts

Each sprint maintains these artifacts:

1. **Sprint Backlog**: List of items selected for the sprint
2. **Sprint Burndown Chart**: Visual representation of progress
3. **Sprint Review Notes**: Documentation of review outcomes
4. **Retrospective Action Items**: List of improvement actions
5. **Sprint Report**: Summary of accomplishments and metrics
