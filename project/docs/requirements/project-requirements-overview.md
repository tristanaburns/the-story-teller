# The Story Teller: Requirements Overview

*Last Updated: 2025-04-28*

## Project Overview

**Project Type:** Next.js Web Application with MongoDB Atlas Integration  
**Languages:** TypeScript, JavaScript  
**Database:** MongoDB Atlas  
**Deployment Target:** Vercel  
**MCP Server Technology:** NestJS

## Summary

The Story Teller is an advanced schema-driven web application designed to create, manage, and visualize rich narrative content with AI assistance. Based on the feature catalogue, it provides comprehensive tools for world building, story creation, and interactive storytelling. The system implements a split-pane workspace for content creation, world dashboard for narrative management, visualization tools for relationships and timelines, and interactive story playback with branching narratives.

## Core Principles

1. **Schema-Driven Development**: All narrative content follows formal schemas
2. **Relationship Integrity**: Maintain connections between narrative elements
3. **AI-Assisted Creativity**: Enhance rather than replace human creativity
4. **Comprehensive Documentation**: Maintain detailed documentation for all aspects
5. **Data Isolation**: User data is completely isolated from other users
6. **Thorough Testing**: 100% test coverage for all components
