# Requirements Documentation

*Last Updated: 2025-04-24*

This directory contains the requirements documentation for The Story Teller project, detailing the functional and non-functional requirements, technical specifications, and system capabilities.

## Purpose

The requirements documentation provides a comprehensive specification of what The Story Teller application must accomplish, serving as the authoritative reference for developers, designers, and stakeholders.

## Documentation Maintenance Requirements

**CRITICAL**: All project requirements documentation must adhere to these mandatory requirements:

1. **Preservation of Requirements**: Requirements and specifications documented here must NEVER be deleted, even if implementation is delayed or in progress.
2. **Scope-Limited Updates**: Documentation updates must be limited to only the specific areas relevant to the change.
3. **No Removal of Planned Features**: Documentation for planned features must be preserved regardless of implementation status.
4. **Structure Preservation**: The existing structure, formatting, and organization of these documents must be maintained.
5. **Change Documentation**: Any significant changes to requirements must be documented with rationale and approved before implementation.

These rules apply to all requirements documentation files. Removing documented requirements, even if not yet implemented, violates project governance procedures.

## Contents

This directory contains:

- **Overview**: High-level summary of the project requirements
- **Functional Requirements**: Detailed specifications of system functionality
- **Non-Functional Requirements**: Performance, security, and other quality attributes
- **Technical Requirements**: Technical specifications and constraints
- **User Experience Requirements**: User interface and experience specifications

## Document Categories

Requirements are organized into these files:

1. **project-requirements-overview.md**: Project summary and high-level requirements
2. **functional-requirements.md**: Detailed functional requirements
3. **non-functional-requirements.md**: Performance, security, reliability, etc.
4. **technical-requirements.md**: Technical specifications and constraints
5. **mcp-requirements.md**: Model Context Protocol (MCP) server requirements

## Using These Documents

These requirements documents should be used by:

- **Developers**: To understand what must be implemented
- **Designers**: To create interfaces that meet requirements
- **Testers**: To develop test plans and validation criteria
- **Project Managers**: To plan and track implementation
- **Stakeholders**: To verify the project meets business needs

## Document Maintenance

Requirements documentation should be updated:

- When stakeholder needs change
- When technical constraints evolve
- When implementation reveals necessary adjustments
- During formal requirements review cycles
- When elaborating on planned features
