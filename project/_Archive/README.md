# Archive

*Last Updated: 2025-04-22*

This directory contains archived files, documents, and code from The Story Teller project that are no longer actively used but are preserved for reference.

## Purpose

The Archive directory serves as a repository for outdated but potentially valuable project artifacts, allowing team members to reference historical approaches, deprecated features, and previous design decisions without cluttering active development directories.

## Contents

This directory may contain:

- **Deprecated code**: Previous implementations that have been replaced
- **Outdated documentation**: Historical versions of project documentation
- **Design alternatives**: Alternative designs that were considered but not implemented
- **Legacy features**: Code for features that were removed from the active project
- **Previous iterations**: Early versions of components or systems
- **Experimental code**: Proof-of-concept implementations and experiments

## Usage Guidelines

1. **Archive, Don't Delete**: When code or documentation is no longer needed but may have future value, move it here rather than deleting it
2. **Maintain Context**: Add a README file to archived directories explaining what was archived and why
3. **Date Everything**: Include dates in filenames or documentation to indicate when items were archived
4. **Keep Organized**: Maintain a logical structure within the archive
5. **Periodic Review**: Occasionally review archived content and delete truly obsolete materials

## Archive Structure

Archived content should maintain its original directory structure where possible and include contextual information:

```
_Archive/
├── feature-name/              # The archived feature
│   ├── README.md              # Explanation of why it was archived
│   ├── original-structure/    # Preserved original structure
│   └── archived-date_reason/  # Date and reason in directory name
├── documentation/
│   └── old-approach/
└── designs/
    └── alternative-concepts/
```

## Retrieval Process

If code needs to be retrieved from the archive:

1. Review the archived code to understand its context and limitations
2. Evaluate whether it needs updating for current standards
3. Test thoroughly before reintroducing to the active codebase
4. Document that the code was retrieved from the archive

## Archive vs. Version Control

While Git provides a historical record of all changes, the Archive directory serves a different purpose:

- More accessible than digging through Git history
- Preserves context and explanations alongside the code
- Maintains complete directories that may span multiple commits
- Includes non-code artifacts that might not be in version control
