# Testing

*Last Updated: 2025-04-22*

This directory contains testing resources, test plans, and documentation for The Story Teller project.

## Purpose

The testing directory provides a centralized location for all testing-related artifacts, ensuring comprehensive test coverage across the application and establishing clear testing standards.

## Contents

- **Test Plans**: Detailed plans for testing different aspects of the application
- **Test Cases**: Specific test scenarios and expected outcomes
- **Test Data**: Sample data used for testing
- **Test Reports**: Results from test runs and testing sprints
- **Testing Tools**: Documentation on tools used for testing
- **Test Automation**: Scripts and configurations for automated testing

## Testing Categories

The Story Teller project implements the following testing categories:

1. **Unit Testing**: Testing individual components and functions in isolation
2. **Integration Testing**: Testing interactions between components
3. **End-to-End Testing**: Testing complete user flows
4. **Performance Testing**: Evaluating system performance under various conditions
5. **Accessibility Testing**: Ensuring compliance with accessibility standards
6. **Security Testing**: Verifying protection against common vulnerabilities
7. **Usability Testing**: Assessing user experience and interface design

## Testing Best Practices

- All new features should include corresponding test cases
- Tests should be maintained alongside code changes
- Test coverage should be monitored and maintained above target thresholds
- Critical paths should have end-to-end test coverage
- Performance benchmarks should be established and monitored
- Tests should be run before merging code changes

## Testing Technology Stack

- **Jest**: For unit and integration testing
- **React Testing Library**: For component testing
- **Cypress**: For end-to-end testing
- **Lighthouse**: For performance and accessibility testing
- **Playwright**: For cross-browser automated testing

## Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
npm test

# Run unit tests
npm run test:unit

# Run integration tests
npm run test:integration

# Run end-to-end tests
npm run test:e2e

# Run tests with coverage report
npm run test:coverage
```

## Test Organization

Tests are organized to mirror the structure of the codebase:

```
testing/
├── unit/                # Unit test specifications
├── integration/         # Integration test specifications
├── e2e/                 # End-to-end test specifications
├── performance/         # Performance test specifications
├── accessibility/       # Accessibility test specifications
├── fixtures/            # Test data and fixtures
└── reports/             # Test reports and results
```
