# [devops] Implement Vercel Deployment Pipeline

**Date:** 2025-04-21 14:00
**Author:** Development Team

## Changes Made
- Created `vercel.json` configuration file with deployment settings, environment variables, and routes
- Added GitHub Actions workflow (`vercel-deployment.yml`) to automate deployment process
- Set up separate workflows for preview deployments (PR) and production deployments (main/production branches)
- Configured environment variables and secrets management
- Updated `service-deployment-guide.md` with comprehensive deployment instructions
- Implemented proper CORS headers and API route protection

## Decisions
- Used GitHub Actions instead of Vercel's built-in GitHub integration for more control over the CI/CD pipeline
- Separated preview and production deployment processes to ensure proper environment-specific settings
- Used environment variables for all sensitive configuration to enhance security
- Implemented deployment protection to only deploy from main and production branches
- Added lint and test steps as prerequisites for deployment to ensure code quality

## Challenges
- Ensuring environment variables are properly transferred to Vercel deployments
- Managing API keys and secrets securely across environments
- Configuring proper CORS headers for API routes
- Balancing security with development convenience in deployment settings

## Next Steps
- Set up monitoring and alerting for production deployments
- Implement database backup and restore procedures
- Create deployment documentation for team members
- Configure performance monitoring for deployed application
- Implement logging system for production deployments
