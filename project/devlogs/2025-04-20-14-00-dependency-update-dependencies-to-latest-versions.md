**Date:** 2025-04-20 14:00
**Author:** Project Team

## Changes Made
- Updated all dependencies to their latest versions in `package.json`:
  - Next.js: 15.3.1
  - React/React DOM: 19.1.0
  - TypeScript: 5.8.3
  - NextAuth.js: 4.24.11
  - MongoDB: 6.15.0
  - Mongoose: 8.13.2
  - TailwindCSS: 4.1.4
  - PostCSS: 8.5.3
  - ESLint: 9.25.0
  - Marked: 15.0.8
  - MongoDB Adapter: 3.9.0
- Updated initialization scripts to use specific versions:
  - Enhanced PowerShell script (`init-project.ps1`)
  - Created Bash script (`init-project.sh`) for Unix/Linux systems
- Added development dependencies:
  - Jest: 29.7.0
  - React Testing Library: 15.0.0
  - Playwright: 1.42.1
  - TypeScript utilities for testing
- Added DEVLOG instructions document with detailed guidelines for maintaining the development log

## Decisions
- **Decision:** Pin exact versions of dependencies rather than using semver ranges.
  **Rationale:** Ensures consistent behavior across all development and production environments.

- **Decision:** Add both Windows and Unix initialization scripts.
  **Rationale:** Provides better support for diverse development environments and ensures consistent setup regardless of operating system.

## Challenges
- Some packages have interdependencies that require specific version combinations
- Finding the correct version of TailwindCSS to work with the latest Next.js version
- Ensuring cross-platform compatibility for initialization scripts

## Next Steps
1. Initialize Next.js application using the updated initialization scripts
2. Configure MongoDB Atlas connection
3. Set up authentication with NextAuth.js
4. Create initial application layout and routing structure
