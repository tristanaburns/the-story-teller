# [Enhancement] Add Model Context Protocol (MCP) Server Integration

**Date:** 2025-04-20 15:00
**Author:** Project Team

## Changes Made
- Updated project documentation to include MCP server integration:
  - Added Memory MCP requirements and implementation plan
  - Added Everart MCP requirements and implementation plan
  - Added Sequential Thinking MCP requirements and implementation plan
  - Added MongoDB Atlas MCP requirements and implementation plan
- Added new data models to support MCP functionality:
  - Memory context model for conversation history
  - Extended existing models with MCP-related fields
- Added new API endpoints for MCP server communication
- Restructured project plan to include MCP server setup and integration phases
- Updated directory structure to accommodate MCP server components

## Decisions
- **Decision:** Integrate four Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers into the application.
  **Rationale:** Enhances AI functionality with specialized capabilities for memory management, art generation, reasoning, and database operations.

- **Decision:** Create separate API routes for each MCP server.
  **Rationale:** Provides clear separation of concerns and allows independent scaling and development of each MCP component.

- **Decision:** Extend project timeline to accommodate MCP integration.
  **Rationale:** Additional complexity requires more development time to ensure proper integration and testing.

## Challenges
- Increased architectural complexity with multiple MCP servers
- Need for orchestration layer to coordinate MCP server interactions
- Additional performance considerations for multi-server architecture
- Maintaining consistent communication protocols across MCP implementations

## Next Steps
1. Set up basic MCP server infrastructure
2. Create communication layer between the application and MCP servers
3. Implement authentication and authorization for MCP server access
4. Develop integration tests for MCP functionality
5. Create user interface components for MCP features
