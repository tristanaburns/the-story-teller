# [Docs] Restructure Development Logs

**Date:** 2025-04-20 17:00
**Author:** Project Team

## Changes Made
- Created new `/project/devlogs/` directory for individual development log entries
- Converted existing monolithic DEVLOG.md content into separate files with date-time-category-title format
- Created comprehensive DEVLOG_INSTRUCTIONS.md with guidelines for maintaining development logs
- Added DEVLOG_INDEX.md with a chronological index of all entries
- Created utility scripts for generating new devlog entries:
  - PowerShell script: `scripts/create-devlog-entry.ps1`
  - Bash script: `scripts/create-devlog-entry.sh`
- Updated project README.md with information about the new devlog structure
- Ensured all existing log entries followed the new format

## Decisions
- **Decision:** Switch from a single development log file to individual files in a dedicated directory.
  **Rationale:** Improves organization, prevents merge conflicts, and makes it easier to browse the project history.

- **Decision:** Create dedicated scripts for generating new log entries.
  **Rationale:** Ensures consistent formatting and automatically updates the index file.

- **Decision:** Name files with reverse date-time format (YYYY-MM-DD-HH-MM).
  **Rationale:** Provides natural chronological sorting in file explorers and command-line tools.

## Challenges
- Ensuring backwards compatibility with existing devlog entries
- Creating a consistent format for all entries
- Designing an efficient system for creating new entries
- Maintaining an up-to-date index of all entries

## Next Steps
1. Ensure all team members understand the new devlog system
2. Integrate devlog creation into the development workflow
3. Consider automating index generation on pre-commit hooks
4. Create tools for querying or filtering devlog entries by category or content
