# [feature] Sequential Thinking MCP Server Logging Implementation

**Date:** 2025-04-22 19:30
**Author:** Development Team

## Changes Made
- Implemented comprehensive debug-level logging system for Sequential Thinking MCP server
- Added MCPLoggerService integration to all components:
  - Updated app.module.ts to import and configure MCPLoggerModule
  - Modified main.ts to use MCPLoggerService as the application logger
  - Applied LogClass and LogMethod decorators to controller, service, and repository
  - Added detailed context tracking across components
- Enhanced logging for the thinking process workflow with appropriate log levels
- Updated .env.example with logging configuration options
- Applied trace-level logging for utility methods and debug-level for business logic
- Added detailed logging for complex operations like process thinking and step processing
- Added error logging with stack traces and detailed context information
- Implemented correlation tracking across asynchronous operations

## Decisions
- Used shared logging module from `mcp-servers/shared/logging` to ensure consistent logging format
- Applied class-level LogClass decorators to minimize repetitive code
- Implemented different log levels based on method importance:
  - trace: Utility methods and formatters
  - debug: Core business operations and repository operations 
  - info: Important service status changes
  - warn/error: Exceptional conditions
- Maintained consistent context through the controller-service-repository chain
- Ensured proper error handling with detailed context for debugging
- Configured all log messages to include processId for easy correlation

## Challenges
- Managing logging in asynchronous thinking process operations
- Implementing correlation ID propagation across asynchronous boundaries
- Capturing all relevant context information without excessive verbosity
- Ensuring that all error paths are properly logged
- Tracking the sequential steps of thinking processes in logs
- Finding the right balance between detailed logging and performance

## Next Steps
- Apply the same logging implementation to the MongoDB Atlas MCP server
- Create log dashboards specific to sequential thinking operations
- Implement log-based analytics and alerts for the thinking process workflow
- Create centralized monitoring for all MCP servers
- Implement log retention and rotation policies
- Add comprehensive tests for the logging system
