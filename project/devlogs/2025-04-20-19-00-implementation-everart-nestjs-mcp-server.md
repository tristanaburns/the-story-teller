# [Implementation] Everart NestJS MCP Server Implementation

**Date:** 2025-04-20 19:00
**Author:** Project Team

## Changes Made
- Implemented the Everart MCP server using NestJS framework:
  - Created the basic project structure with TypeScript config
  - Implemented MongoDB schemas for Artwork and Style
  - Created comprehensive DTOs for all operations
  - Implemented the repository pattern for Artwork and Style
  - Added API key authentication with configurable requirements
  - Implemented error handling with custom exception filters
  - Created the controller with MCP protocol support
  - Implemented the service layer with all required functionality
  - Added Docker and Docker Compose configuration
  - Created detailed README documentation
- Implemented key Everart functionality:
  - Character portrait generation (simulated)
  - Location visualization (simulated)
  - Scene illustration creation (simulated)
  - Style management system with system, user, and story-level styles
  - Comprehensive artwork metadata tracking
  - Search and filtering capabilities
  - Tagging system for organization

## Decisions
- **Decision:** Use separate Mongoose schemas for Artwork and Style entities.
  **Rationale:** This provides cleaner separation of concerns and better schema organization.

- **Decision:** Implement a simulated artwork generation in this initial version.
  **Rationale:** Allows development to proceed in parallel with AI integration decisions.

- **Decision:** Use repository pattern for database operations.
  **Rationale:** Provides better separation of concerns, easier testing, and more maintainable code.

- **Decision:** Set up predefined system styles.
  **Rationale:** Gives users a starting point for artwork generation without requiring them to create styles first.

- **Decision:** Use Docker Compose for local development.
  **Rationale:** Simplifies setup with integrated MongoDB and allows for easier testing in an isolated environment.

## Challenges
- **Challenge:** Handling different artwork types (character, location, scene) with a unified API.
  **Solution:** Created a common data model with type-specific metadata fields.

- **Challenge:** Maintaining style consistency across different artwork generations.
  **Solution:** Implemented a hierarchical style system with parameter inheritance.

- **Challenge:** Setting up proper authentication that can be toggled.
  **Solution:** Created a configurable API key guard that can be enabled or disabled through environment variables.

- **Challenge:** Implementing mock artwork generation for development.
  **Solution:** Created a placeholder implementation that demonstrates the flow and responses without actual AI integration.

## Next Steps
1. Implement the Sequential Thinking MCP server following the same pattern
2. Implement the MongoDB Atlas MCP server
3. Update the client utilities in the main application to work with the Everart MCP server
4. Create UI components for artwork management
5. Add comprehensive integration tests between the main application and MCP servers
6. Integrate with actual image generation API (e.g., OpenAI DALL-E)
