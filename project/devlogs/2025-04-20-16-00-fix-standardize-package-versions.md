# [Fix] Standardize Package Versions

**Date:** 2025-04-20 16:00
**Author:** Project Team

## Changes Made
- Updated package.json to use exact versions matching the initialization script:
  - Removed caret (^) prefix from all dependency versions
  - Corrected version discrepancies:
    - autoprefixer: 10.4.21 → 10.4.16
    - swr: 2.3.3 → 2.2.5
    - d3: 7.9.0 → 7.8.5
    - @types/node: 22.14.1 → 20.10.8
    - @types/react: 19.1.2 → 19.1.0
    - @types/react-dom: 19.1.2 → 19.1.0
    - @testing-library/react: 16.3.0 → 15.0.0
    - @testing-library/jest-dom: 6.6.3 → 6.4.2
    - mongodb-memory-server: 10.1.4 → 9.1.6
    - @playwright/test: 1.52.0 → 1.42.1
    - ts-jest: 29.3.2 → 29.1.2

## Decisions
- **Decision:** Use exact version numbers instead of semver ranges (removed ^ prefix)
  **Rationale:** Ensures consistent behavior across all environments and development machines

- **Decision:** Match all dependency versions to those in the initialization script
  **Rationale:** Prevents potential compatibility issues between different package versions

## Challenges
- Ensuring all dependencies work together harmoniously
- Balancing latest features with stability requirements
- Maintaining consistency between initialization script and package.json

## Next Steps
1. Test the application with the standardized dependency versions
2. Update initialization scripts if any compatibility issues are discovered
3. Document any version-specific behaviors or workarounds if needed
