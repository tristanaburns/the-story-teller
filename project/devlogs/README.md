# The Story Teller: Developer Logs

This directory contains development logs for The Story Teller project, tracking progress, decisions, challenges, and solutions throughout the development lifecycle.

## Purpose of Developer Logs

Developer logs serve to:

- Document the evolution of the project over time
- Record technical decisions and their rationale
- Track implemented features and changes
- Note challenges encountered and solutions applied
- Provide context for future developers and team members
- Support knowledge transfer and onboarding

## Devlog Structure

Each devlog entry should follow the standardized structure outlined in the DEVLOG_INSTRUCTIONS.md file in this directory, typically including:

1. **Date and Author**: When the log was created and by whom
2. **Summary**: Brief overview of what was accomplished
3. **Features Implemented**: Specific functionality added
4. **Technical Decisions**: Architecture and implementation choices made
5. **Challenges**: Problems encountered during development
6. **Solutions**: How challenges were addressed
7. **Next Steps**: Planned future work

## How to Use Devlogs

Devlogs can be utilized in several ways:

- **Project History**: Understand how and why the project evolved
- **Knowledge Transfer**: Help new team members understand past decisions
- **Troubleshooting**: Find previous solutions to recurring issues
- **Progress Tracking**: Monitor development velocity and milestones
- **Reference**: Look up implementation details of specific features

## Devlog Best Practices

When creating or updating devlogs:

1. **Be Specific**: Include concrete details rather than vague descriptions
2. **Focus on Value**: Emphasize information that will be useful to future readers
3. **Include Context**: Explain why decisions were made, not just what was done
4. **Reference Related Materials**: Link to relevant code, issues, or documentation
5. **Be Honest**: Document failures and lessons learned as well as successes

## Maintaining Devlogs

Guidelines for maintaining the devlogs collection:

1. Create new entries at significant development milestones
2. Update the log regularly during active development phases
3. Ensure all team members contribute to the logs
4. Review logs periodically for insights and patterns
5. Archive older logs in an organized, searchable manner

## Relation to Other Documentation

Devlogs complement other documentation by:

- Providing the historical context behind technical documentation
- Explaining the evolution leading to the current architecture
- Recording the implementation journey in more detail than formal docs
- Capturing temporary workarounds that informed permanent solutions

## Devlog Review Process

Periodically, the development team should:

1. Review devlogs to extract patterns and insights
2. Identify recurring challenges that may need architectural solutions
3. Update technical documentation based on devlog insights
4. Use devlogs to inform retrospectives and process improvements
5. Ensure devlogs remain accessible and useful to the team
