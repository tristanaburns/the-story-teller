## Changes Made
- Created a comprehensive database indexing system in `lib/database/indexes.ts`
- Implemented indexes for all major collections:
  - Stories (title, creation date, text search)
  - Characters (name, story ID, attributes, text search)
  - Locations (name, coordinates, text search)
  - Timeline events (date, participants, text search)
  - Relationships (various relationship fields)
  - Story content (version, text search)
  - Settings (user ID unique index)
  - Logs (timestamp, level, correlation ID)
  - MCP-specific collections (context, importance, etc.)
- Updated the user database creation process to automatically set up indexes
- Created a utility to update indexes for all existing databases
- Added functionality to check for and create missing collections during updates
- Enhanced error handling and logging for database operations

## Decisions
- Created text search indexes for all narrative content to enable efficient search
- Used compound indexes for frequently queried field combinations
- Implemented unique indexes where appropriate (e.g., user settings)
- Added geo-spatial indexes for location coordinates to support map visualizations
- Created a maintenance script that can be run periodically to update indexes
- Ensured indexes are created during initial database setup and checked on each access
- Implemented collection existence checks to handle cases where collections might be missing

## Challenges
- Balancing index coverage with index size and write performance
- Ensuring appropriate error handling for index creation operations
- Managing the update process for existing databases
- Creating an approach that works across different MongoDB versions
- Implementing a solution that can be extended for future collections and indexes

## Next Steps
- Monitor index usage patterns to optimize further
- Add performance metrics collection for database operations
- Create an admin dashboard to view database status and performance
- Implement automatic periodic index rebuilding for optimization
- Set up index usage stats collection to identify unused indexes
- Enhance the indexing system to support sharding for very large databases
