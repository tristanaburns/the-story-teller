# [Enhancement] NestJS MCP Server Implementation

**Date:** 2025-04-20 17:00
**Author:** Project Team

## Changes Made
- Created a NestJS implementation for the Memory MCP server
- Implemented MongoDB integration using Mongoose
- Added DTO validation with class-validator
- Implemented API key authentication
- Created Swagger documentation
- Added Docker support for containerization
- Aligned NestJS implementation with existing MCP protocol
- Enhanced the API structure with proper controller and service patterns
- Implemented standardized error handling

## Decisions
- **Decision:** Use NestJS for all API backends that cannot be handled by Next.js.
  **Rationale:** NestJS provides a more structured, enterprise-ready framework with better TypeScript integration, dependency injection, and a module-based architecture.

- **Decision:** Keep the same MCP protocol for communication.
  **Rationale:** Maintains compatibility with existing client implementations while improving the server-side codebase.

- **Decision:** Use Mongoose with NestJS for MongoDB integration.
  **Rationale:** Provides schema validation, type safety, and integration with NestJS's dependency injection system.

- **Decision:** Add Swagger documentation.
  **Rationale:** Improves API discoverability and makes it easier for teams to understand and integrate with the MCP servers.

## Challenges
- **Challenge:** Maintaining compatibility with existing MCP protocol while leveraging NestJS features.
  **Solution:** Created custom DTOs that match the existing protocol structure while adding validation.

- **Challenge:** Implementing proper error handling with standardized responses.
  **Solution:** Created custom exception filters that format errors according to the MCP protocol specification.

- **Challenge:** Managing authentication across multiple NestJS MCP servers.
  **Solution:** Implemented a reusable API key authentication strategy with configuration options.

## Next Steps
1. Convert the remaining MCP servers (Everart, Sequential Thinking, MongoDB Atlas) to NestJS
2. Create a shared library for common MCP functionality
3. Implement end-to-end tests for the NestJS MCP servers
4. Add CI/CD pipeline for MCP server deployment
5. Update the client libraries to work with the NestJS implementation
6. Create a comprehensive monitoring solution for all MCP servers
