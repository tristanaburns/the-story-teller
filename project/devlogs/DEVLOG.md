## Comprehensive Logging System Implementation - 2025-04-23

Today I implemented a comprehensive logging system that captures detailed information across all parts of the application. The system provides full visibility into function inputs/outputs, database operations, API calls, authentication events, and client-side interactions.

### Key Features Added

1. **Enhanced Logger Configuration**: Modified the core logger to always enable debug-level logging for capturing function inputs and outputs.

2. **Method Decorators**: Added TypeScript decorators (`@LogMethod()`, `@LogDebug()`, etc.) for easy function logging. These automatically capture:
   - All parameters passed to functions
   - Return values from functions
   - Error details if an exception occurs
   - Execution timing

3. **Function Wrappers**: Created utility functions to wrap standalone functions with logging functionality (`logFunction()`, `logFunctionDebug()`, etc.).

4. **MongoDB Collection Proxies**: Implemented automatic logging of all database operations with:
   - Collection name and operation type
   - Query parameters and options
   - Results and affected document counts
   - Execution timing

5. **Enhanced API Middleware**: Improved the API middleware to log:
   - Request details (method, path, headers, query parameters)
   - Authentication status and user ID
   - Response status and timing
   - Error details with stack traces

6. **React Hooks for Client Logging**:
   - `useClientLogger()` - Component-specific logger
   - `useLoggedFunction()` - Wraps event handlers with logging
   - `useNavigationLogging()` - Tracks page navigation and performance
   - `useLoggedEffect()` - Monitors React lifecycle events

7. **Logging Provider**: Added a `LoggingProvider` component in the root layout that:
   - Initializes client-side logging
   - Captures global errors and unhandled rejections
   - Tracks session state changes
   - Monitors user interactions with UI elements

8. **Automatic Session Tracking**: Added automatic logging of authentication state changes.

The logging system is designed to provide comprehensive visibility while maintaining performance. Sensitive data is automatically redacted, and correlation IDs are used to track requests across components. All logs include timestamps, component names, and relevant context information.

**Documentation**: I've added comprehensive documentation in `lib/logging/README.md` that explains the system and provides examples of how to use each component.

### Next Steps

- Monitor logging performance in production
- Consider implementing log aggregation and analysis tools
- Create dashboard visualizations for log data

### Technical Notes

- All logging is enabled at DEBUG level by default
- Log data is stored in MongoDB for persistence
- Client-side logs are batched and sent to the server
- Correlation IDs track requests across server and client components
- The system automatically handles circular references and sanitizes sensitive data
