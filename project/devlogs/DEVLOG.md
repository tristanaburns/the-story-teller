## 2025-04-20 - [Fix] Standardize Package Versions

**Author:** Project Team

### Changes Made
- Updated package.json to use exact versions matching the initialization script:
  - Removed caret (^) prefix from all dependency versions
  - Corrected version discrepancies:
    - autoprefixer: 10.4.21 → 10.4.16
    - swr: 2.3.3 → 2.2.5
    - d3: 7.9.0 → 7.8.5
    - @types/node: 22.14.1 → 20.10.8
    - @types/react: 19.1.2 → 19.1.0
    - @types/react-dom: 19.1.2 → 19.1.0

    - @playwright/test: 1.52.0 → 1.42.1
    - ts-jest: 29.3.2 → 29.1.2

### Decisions
- **Decision:** Use exact version numbers instead of semver ranges (removed ^ prefix)
  **Rationale:** Ensures consistent behavior across all environments and development machines

- **Decision:** Match all dependency versions to those in the initialization script
  **Rationale:** Prevents potential compatibility issues between different package versions

### Challenges
- Ensuring all dependencies work together harmoniously
- Balancing latest features with stability requirements

- Better scalability for individual users
- Simplified access control
- Potentially better performance for user-specific queries
- Easier to implement per-user backup and restore

#### State Management
**Decision:** Use React Context API and SWR for data fetching instead of Redux.

**Rationale:**
- Simpler implementation for our use case
- Built-in caching and revalidation with SWR
- Reduced boilerplate code
- Better performance for our specific application structure
- Easier to understand for new developers

#### Deployment Platform
**Decision:** Deploy on Vercel with MongoDB Atlas.

**Rationale:**
- Optimized for Next.js applications
- Simplified deployment workflow
- Global CDN with edge functions
- Good integration with GitHub
- Easy environment configuration
- Automatic SSL certificates

### Challenges
- Determining optimal project structure that integrates with existing files
- Designing database architecture for user-specific MongoDB databases

- Managing schema compatibility between existing JSON schemas and MongoDB

### Next Steps
1. Initialize the Next.js application
2. Implement authentication with NextAuth.js
3. Set up MongoDB Atlas connection
4. Create user-specific database provisioning
5. Implement story management API
6. Develop dashboard UI
7. Create AI integration API endpoint

## Comprehensive Logging System Implementation - 2025-04-23

Today I implemented a comprehensive logging system that captures detailed information across all parts of the application. The system provides full visibility into function inputs/outputs, database operations, API calls, authentication events, and client-side interactions.

### Key Features Added

1. **Enhanced Logger Configuration**: Modified the core logger to always enable debug-level logging for capturing function inputs and outputs.

2. **Method Decorators**: Added TypeScript decorators (`@LogMethod()`, `@LogDebug()`, etc.) for easy function logging. These automatically capture:
   - All parameters passed to functions
   - Return values from functions
   - Error details if an exception occurs
   - Execution timing

3. **Function Wrappers**: Created utility functions to wrap standalone functions with logging functionality (`logFunction()`, `logFunctionDebug()`, etc.).

4. **MongoDB Collection Proxies**: Implemented automatic logging of all database operations with:
   - Collection name and operation type
   - Query parameters and options
   - Results and affected document counts
   - Execution timing

5. **Enhanced API Middleware**: Improved the API middleware to log:
   - Request details (method, path, headers, query parameters)
   - Authentication status and user ID
   - Response status and timing
   - Error details with stack traces

6. **React Hooks for Client Logging**:
   - `useClientLogger()` - Component-specific logger
   - `useLoggedFunction()` - Wraps event handlers with logging
   - `useNavigationLogging()` - Tracks page navigation and performance
   - `useLoggedEffect()` - Monitors React lifecycle events

7. **Logging Provider**: Added a `LoggingProvider` component in the root layout that:
   - Initializes client-side logging
   - Captures global errors and unhandled rejections
   - Tracks session state changes
   - Monitors user interactions with UI elements

8. **Automatic Session Tracking**: Added automatic logging of authentication state changes.

The logging system is designed to provide comprehensive visibility while maintaining performance. Sensitive data is automatically redacted, and correlation IDs are used to track requests across components. All logs include timestamps, component names, and relevant context information.

**Documentation**: I've added comprehensive documentation in `lib/logging/README.md` that explains the system and provides examples of how to use each component.

### Next Steps

- Monitor logging performance in production
- Consider implementing log aggregation and analysis tools
- Create dashboard visualizations for log data

### Technical Notes

- All logging is enabled at DEBUG level by default
- Log data is stored in MongoDB for persistence
- Client-side logs are batched and sent to the server
- Correlation IDs track requests across server and client components
- The system automatically handles circular references and sanitizes sensitive data
