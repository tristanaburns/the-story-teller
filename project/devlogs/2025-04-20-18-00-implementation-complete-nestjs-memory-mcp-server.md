**Date:** 2025-04-20 18:00
**Author:** Project Team

## Changes Made
- Completed the NestJS implementation of the Memory MCP server:
  - Created comprehensive DTO validation for all endpoints
  - Implemented repository pattern for database operations
  - Added error handling with custom exception filters
  - Integrated API key authentication with configurable requirements
  - Added detailed Swagger API documentation
  - Created unit and e2e test setup
  - Added Docker and Docker Compose configuration
  - Implemented structured logging
  - Added health check endpoint
  - Created comprehensive README documentation
- Enhanced the Memory MCP functionality:
  - Added memory consolidation for summarizing multiple memories
  - Improved memory search with advanced filtering
  - Added importance-based ranking of memories
  - Implemented context-aware memory management

## Decisions
- **Decision:** Use the repository pattern for database operations.
  **Rationale:** Provides better separation of concerns, easier testing, and more maintainable code.

- **Decision:** Implement custom exception filters for MCP protocol.
  **Rationale:** Ensures all errors are consistently formatted according to the MCP protocol, providing better error handling for client applications.

- **Decision:** Use Docker Compose for local development.
  **Rationale:** Simplifies setup with integrated MongoDB and allows for easier testing in an isolated environment.

- **Decision:** Add comprehensive Swagger documentation.
  **Rationale:** Improves developer experience and provides clear API reference for integration.

## Challenges
- **Challenge:** Maintaining consistency with the MCP protocol while leveraging NestJS features.
  **Solution:** Created custom DTOs and exception filters that ensure all requests and responses conform to the MCP protocol.

- **Challenge:** Implementing flexible memory search and consolidation.
  **Solution:** Designed a repository with a flexible query builder that supports various search criteria and filters.

- **Challenge:** Ensuring proper error handling across different endpoints.
  **Solution:** Implemented global exception filters that catch and format all errors according to the MCP protocol.

- **Challenge:** Setting up proper authentication that can be toggled.
  **Solution:** Created a configurable API key guard that can be enabled or disabled through environment variables.

## Next Steps
1. Update the client utilities in the main application to work with the NestJS Memory MCP server
2. Implement the remaining MCP servers (Everart, Sequential Thinking, MongoDB Atlas) using the same pattern
3. Create a unified MCP orchestration layer
4. Develop UI components for Memory MCP functionality
5. Add comprehensive integration tests between the main application and MCP servers
