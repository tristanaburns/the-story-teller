## Overview

Implemented the Sequential Thinking MCP server using NestJS, following the established patterns from the Memory MCP and Everart MCP servers. This server provides step-by-step reasoning capabilities to assist with narrative development, character motivation analysis, plot planning, and world-building consistency.

## Implementation Details

### Key Components

1. **Schema Design:**
   - Created a `ThinkingProcess` schema with fields for:
     - Title and description of the thinking problem
     - Steps with reasoning and conclusions
     - Final conclusions
     - Status tracking (in_progress, completed, abandoned)
     - Thinking type categorization (character, plot, worldbuilding, analysis)

2. **API Endpoints:**
   - `analyze` - Start a new thinking process
   - `addStep` - Add a reasoning step to a process
   - `complete` - Mark a process as complete with final conclusions
   - `getProcess` - Retrieve a specific process
   - `search` - Find processes with filtering
   - `delete` - Remove a process

3. **Repository Pattern:**
   - Implemented a dedicated repository for database operations
   - Added specialized query methods for searching and filtering

4. **Authentication:**
   - Integrated API key authentication consistent with other MCP servers
   - Added configuration options to enable/disable authentication

5. **Docker Support:**
   - Created Dockerfile and docker-compose.yml for containerized deployment

## Technical Architecture

The server follows the standard NestJS architecture with:

- Controllers handling HTTP requests
- Services implementing business logic
- DTOs for request/response validation
- Repository pattern for data access
- Mongoose for MongoDB integration

## Testing Strategy

Created unit tests for the service layer, focusing on:
- Process creation and retrieval
- Step addition and manipulation
- Process completion
- Search functionality

## Next Steps

1. **Integration Testing:** Add integration tests with a MongoDB test instance
2. **Frontend Integration:** Connect to the Next.js application
3. **Advanced Features:** Implement more sophisticated reasoning patterns
4. **Documentation:** Create user guides for effective sequential thinking
