# [Setup] Project Documentation and Structure

**Date:** 2025-04-20 10:00
**Author:** Project Team

## Changes Made
- Created project documentation structure:
  - `project-requirements.md`: Detailed functional and non-functional requirements
  - `project-plan.md`: Development roadmap and timeline
  - `project-structure.md`: Technical structure and architecture
  - `service-deployment-guide.md`: Deployment instructions
  - `test-implementation-plan.md`: Testing strategy and examples
  - `DEVLOG_INSTRUCTIONS.md`: Guidelines for maintaining development logs
  - `README.md`: Project overview and setup instructions
- Created `/project` directory to organize documentation
- Established initial Next.js application structure
- Created PowerShell initialization script

## Decisions

### Authentication Approach
**Decision:** Use NextAuth.js with Google and GitHub OAuth providers.

**Rationale:**
- Simplifies OAuth integration
- Provides session management
- Handles token rotation
- Supports multiple providers
- Well-maintained library with good documentation

### Database Architecture
**Decision:** Each user gets their own MongoDB database with collections for stories, characters, locations, etc.

**Rationale:**
- Clear separation of user data
- Better scalability for individual users
- Simplified access control
- Potentially better performance for user-specific queries
- Easier to implement per-user backup and restore

### State Management
**Decision:** Use React Context API and SWR for data fetching instead of Redux.

**Rationale:**
- Simpler implementation for our use case
- Built-in caching and revalidation with SWR
- Reduced boilerplate code
- Better performance for our specific application structure
- Easier to understand for new developers

### Deployment Platform
**Decision:** Deploy on Vercel with MongoDB Atlas.

**Rationale:**
- Optimized for Next.js applications
- Simplified deployment workflow
- Global CDN with edge functions
- Good integration with GitHub
- Easy environment configuration
- Automatic SSL certificates

## Challenges
- Determining optimal project structure that integrates with existing files
- Designing database architecture for user-specific MongoDB databases
- Establishing secure API for OpenAI Custom GPT integration
- Managing schema compatibility between existing JSON schemas and MongoDB

## Next Steps
1. Initialize the Next.js application
2. Implement authentication with NextAuth.js
3. Set up MongoDB Atlas connection
4. Create user-specific database provisioning
5. Implement story management API
6. Develop dashboard UI
7. Create AI integration API endpoint
