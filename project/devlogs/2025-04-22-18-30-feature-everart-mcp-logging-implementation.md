# [feature] Everart MCP Server Logging Implementation

**Date:** 2025-04-22 18:30
**Author:** Development Team

## Changes Made
- Implemented comprehensive debug-level logging system for Everart MCP server
- Added MCPLoggerService integration to all components:
  - Updated app.module.ts to import and configure MCPLoggerModule
  - Modified main.ts to use MCPLoggerService as the application logger
  - Applied LogClass and LogMethod decorators to controller, service, and repositories
  - Added context tracking and correlation ID propagation
- Created detailed logging in all repository operations
- Updated .env.example with logging configuration options
- Added sensitive data masking in logs
- Implemented detailed logging for system style initialization
- Added error logging with stack traces and context
- Applied class-level decorators to minimize code changes

## Decisions
- Used shared logging module from `mcp-servers/shared/logging` to ensure consistent logging approach
- Applied LogClass decorators at the class level to reduce repetition
- Added more fine-grained logging for crucial operations like system style initialization
- Set proper log levels (info for important operations, debug for detailed monitoring)
- Maintained correlation ID tracking across components
- Added context to log messages for better filtering and analysis
- Sanitized sensitive data in all logs

## Challenges
- Ensuring consistent logging patterns across all layers of the application
- Maintaining proper error handling while capturing detailed error information
- Balancing log verbosity with performance considerations
- Injecting the logger service into repositories without creating circular dependencies
- Implementing error handling in asynchronous operations
- Maintaining correlation IDs across controller-service-repository calls

## Next Steps
- Apply the same logging implementation to the Sequential Thinking NestJS MCP server
- Update the MongoDB Atlas NestJS MCP server with comprehensive logging
- Create log query and visualization features for the MCP servers
- Implement log rotation and retention policies
- Add log-based alerting for critical operations
- Add comprehensive tests for logging functionality
