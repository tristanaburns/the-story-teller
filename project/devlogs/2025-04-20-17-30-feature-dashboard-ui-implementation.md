## Schema Integration

The UI components were designed to align with the schema-driven approach of the application:

**Solution**: Implemented a mobile-first approach with Tailwind CSS breakpoints and a collapsible navigation menu for smaller screens.

**Challenge**: Handling markdown content in a user-friendly way.

**Solution**: Used the marked library for rendering markdown content and implemented a split-view approach for editing, with clear instructions about markdown support.

**Challenge**: Managing complex form state for story creation and editing.

**Solution**: Created specialized form handling logic to manage nested metadata fields and array-based data like tags.

## Next Steps

1. Implement character management UI components
2. Create location management interfaces
3. Develop timeline visualization components
4. Implement relationship visualization for narrative elements
5. Add AI integration for content generation assistance
