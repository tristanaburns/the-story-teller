# [feature] Schema Validation Implementation

**Date:** 2025-04-28 16:00
**Author:** Development Team

## Changes Made

- Implemented comprehensive schema validation system for MTP requirements:
  - Enhanced `SchemaValidator` class with improved error handling and formatting
  - Created `SchemaLoader` utility to load schemas from the database_schemas directory
  - Implemented `schema-init.ts` for application startup schema registration
  - Created specialized `PassageValidator` for validating AI-generated content
  - Implemented `/api/ai/draft` endpoint for AI passage generation with validation
  - Added database initialization with per-user MongoDB databases and schema validation
  - Created database middleware for user-specific database connections

- Added integration with the existing JSON schemas:
  - Loaded schema definitions from database_schemas directory
  - Integrated with MongoDB validation for database schemas
  - Ensured schema-driven validation for all API endpoints

## Decisions

- **Decision:** Use Ajv for JSON Schema validation
  **Rationale:** Industry standard with excellent performance and TypeScript support

- **Decision:** Implement per-user MongoDB databases
  **Rationale:** Provides complete data isolation between users as required in the project blueprint

- **Decision:** Create a specialized passage validator for AI-generated content
  **Rationale:** Ensures consistent validation and error handling for a critical MTP component

- **Decision:** Implement a unified schema initialization system
  **Rationale:** Centralizes schema management and ensures consistency across the application

## Challenges

- Handling schema references and dependencies between multiple schema files
- Implementing error handling and formatting for schema validation errors
- Ensuring schema compatibility between MongoDB validation and JSON Schema
- Balancing performance considerations with comprehensive validation
- Managing the lifecycle of database connections within the API routes

## Next Steps

1. Implement comprehensive tests for schema validation
2. Complete the integration with MCP servers for AI generation
3. Enhance error handling and user feedback for validation failures
4. Optimize schema validation performance for larger documents
5. Implement schema version management and migration
