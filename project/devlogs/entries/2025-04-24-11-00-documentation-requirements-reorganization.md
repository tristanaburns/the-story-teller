# Requirements Documentation Reorganization

## Summary

Reorganized project requirements documentation to enhance modularity, improve discoverability, and reduce duplication. The consolidated `project-requirements.md` file was distributed to appropriate files in the newly created `project/docs/requirements/` directory, and references to the now-deleted file were updated across documentation.

## Changes

1. **Content Distribution**: 
   - Created new `project/docs/requirements/` directory
   - Distributed content from `project-requirements.md` to the following files:
     - `project/docs/requirements/README.md` (Documentation maintenance requirements)
     - `project/docs/requirements/project-requirements-overview.md` (Project overview and summary)
     - `project/docs/requirements/functional-requirements.md` (Functional requirements)
     - `project/docs/requirements/non-functional-requirements.md` (Non-functional requirements)
     - `project/docs/requirements/technical-requirements.md` (Technical requirements)
     - `project/docs/requirements/mcp-requirements.md` (MCP server requirements)

2. **Structure Updates**:
   - Updated `project/docs/index.md` to include the requirements directory
   - Improved cross-referencing between requirements documents
   - Enhanced relation sections to connect requirements documents

3. **Reference Updates**:
   - Updated `project/README.md` to point to individual requirements files
   - Updated `project/claude-desktop-project-instructions.md` to remove references to `project-requirements.md`
   - Added clarification on requirements structure in Claude's instructions

4. **File Deletion**:
   - Removed `project/project-requirements.md` after verifying all content was properly redistributed

## Rationale

This reorganization addresses several documentation challenges:

1. **Improved Organization**: Separated requirements by type for better organization
2. **Enhanced Discoverability**: Made it easier to find specific requirements
3. **Reduced Duplication**: Eliminated redundancy across documentation
4. **Better Maintenance**: Isolated specific requirement types for easier updates
5. **Preserved Content**: Maintained all content while reorganizing structure

## Implementation Notes

- Careful attention was paid to preserving all requirements, especially unimplemented features
- Documentation maintenance requirements were emphasized in the requirements directory README
- Added a "Last Updated" date of 2025-04-24 to all new files for consistency
- Enhanced cross-references between documents to improve navigation

## Future Considerations

- Consider additional requirements categories if needed in the future
- Evaluate metrics for requirements traceability to implementation
- Consider automated requirements validation tools
- Review requirements periodically to ensure they remain accurate and complete
