# [feature] MCP Server Comprehensive Logging Implementation

**Date:** 2025-04-22 17:30
**Author:** Development Team

## Changes Made
- Implemented comprehensive debug-level logging system for Memory MCP server as first MCP server with full logging
- Added MCPLoggerService integration to all key components in Memory MCP server:
  - Updated app.module.ts to import and configure MCPLoggerModule
  - Modified main.ts to use MCPLoggerService as the application logger
  - Applied LogClass and LogMethod decorators to controller, service, and repository classes
  - Added context tracking and correlation ID propagation
- Updated .env.example with detailed logging configuration options
- Added sensitive data masking in log output for better security
- Configured MongoDB storage for logs with proper sanitization
- Applied consistent logging patterns across controller, service, and repository layers
- Standardized log format across all MCP components

## Decisions
- Used the shared logging module from `mcp-servers/shared/logging` to ensure consistent logging format and behavior
- Applied class-level decorators to simplify adding logging to multiple methods
- Selected Winston as the underlying logging library for its flexibility and extensibility
- Added MongoDB transport for centralized log storage and analysis
- Implemented different log levels for console (debug) and MongoDB (info) to balance verbosity with performance
- Used context-based logging patterns to maintain correlation IDs across asynchronous operations
- Implemented ClsService (Continuation Local Storage) via nestjs-cls for tracking context in asynchronous operations
- Standardized on debug-level logging during development with configurable log levels for production

## Challenges
- Ensuring consistent log format across all modules and servers
- Maintaining correlation IDs across asynchronous boundaries within NestJS
- Properly sanitizing sensitive data without excessive performance impact
- Balancing log verbosity with system performance
- Ensuring proper error handling in logging mechanisms themselves
- Integrating with NestJS's existing logger functionality without conflicts
- Ensuring proper TypeScript type safety throughout the logging implementation

## Next Steps
- Apply the same logging implementation to the other MCP servers:
  - everart-nest
  - sequential-thinking-nest
  - mongodb-atlas-nest
- Implement log rotation and retention policies
- Create log analysis and visualization dashboards specific to MCP operations
- Add metrics collection for MCP server performance monitoring
- Implement log-based alerting for critical MCP server errors
- Expand the implementation to include more detailed context information
- Create comprehensive tests for the logging functionality
