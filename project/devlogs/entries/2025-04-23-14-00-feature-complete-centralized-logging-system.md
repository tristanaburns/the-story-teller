## Implementation Details

### Context Collection and Correlation Propagation
- Created middleware for capturing HTTP request context including:
  - Correlation IDs for end-to-end request tracking
  - User IDs from authentication
  - Client information (IP, user agent, browser, OS)
  - Request path and method
  - Performance metrics
- Added utilities for propagating correlation IDs across service boundaries
- Implemented fetch wrappers with automatic correlation ID handling
- Added MCP server request support for consistent tracking
- Created customizable context extraction mechanism
- Implemented thread-local storage for maintaining context across async operations
- Added detailed browser info extraction from user agent strings

### Analytics System
- Created modules for analyzing log data:
  - Performance issue detection with configurable thresholds
  - Error pattern detection with grouping and aggregation
  - User behavior analytics for understanding usage patterns
  - Request flow analysis for end-to-end tracking
  - System health metrics calculation
- Implemented configurable thresholds for different operations
- Added time-window based analysis for pattern detection
- Created detailed analytics reports with actionable insights
- Implemented filtering and aggregation for focused analysis
- Added correlation tracking between related log entries

### Alerting System
- Created a rule-based alerting system with:
  - Multiple alert severity levels (INFO, WARNING, ERROR, CRITICAL)
  - Different alert types (ERROR_PATTERN, PERFORMANCE_ISSUE, SYSTEM_HEALTH, SECURITY, CUSTOM)
  - Customizable alert rules with conditions and thresholds
  - Multiple notification channels (CONSOLE, EMAIL, SLACK, WEBHOOK, INTERNAL)
  - Deduplication and throttling mechanisms
  - Alert acknowledgment and resolution tracking
- Implemented default alert rules for common scenarios
  - High error rate detection
  - Slow response time monitoring
  - Repeated error pattern detection
  - Performance degradation alerts
- Added customizable alert templates with variable substitution
- Implemented alert history and retrieval functionality
- Added support for custom alert notifiers

### Log Rotation
- Implemented log file rotation functionality:
  - Size-based rotation with configurable thresholds
  - Automatic compression of rotated logs
  - Customizable file naming with date patterns
  - Retention policy for managing file count
  - Scheduled rotation checks at configurable intervals
- Added automatic log directory creation
- Implemented background rotation task management
- Created API for manual rotation triggering
- Added robust error handling for filesystem operations

### Sensitive Data Masking
- Implemented comprehensive sensitive data masking:
  - Pattern-based detection of sensitive fields
  - Special handling for credentials in URLs
  - Email address and IP address masking
  - Custom masking functions for special formats (credit cards, phone numbers)
  - Configuration options for masking behavior
- Added default patterns for common sensitive fields
  - Passwords, tokens, API keys, secrets
  - Personal identifiable information
  - Financial information
- Implemented recursive object scanning for nested sensitive data
- Added special handling for arrays and complex objects
- Created utility for adding custom patterns and validation rules

## Decisions
- Used thread-local storage for context propagation to ensure data is available across asynchronous boundaries
- Implemented a middleware-based approach for context collection to maintain separation of concerns
- Used a rule-based system for alerting to provide maximum flexibility
- Implemented a centralized configuration system for all logging components
- Added robust error handling to ensure logging system failures don't impact application behavior
- Applied defensive programming throughout with fallbacks for missing context values
- Maintained backward compatibility with existing logging implementation
- Used configurable thresholds for analytics to support different operational requirements
- Implemented log rotation using Node.js file system API for precise control over rotation behavior
- Applied sensitive data masking consistently across all logging components

## Challenges
- Ensuring proper context propagation across asynchronous operations
- Balancing logging verbosity with performance impact
- Managing potential performance impact of log analytics on production systems
- Detecting and properly masking sensitive data in various formats
- Ensuring thread safety for context storage in concurrent requests
- Maintaining correlation tracking across service boundaries
- Handling large log files efficiently during rotation
- Designing a flexible yet easy-to-use alerting system
- Dealing with timezone inconsistencies in log timestamps
- Integrating with various notification channels securely

## Next Steps
- Create log visualization dashboard with D3.js
- Implement log-based anomaly detection using statistical models
- Add real-time monitoring capabilities for critical metrics
- Create export functionality for log analytics
- Implement internationalization for alert messages
- Add machine learning capabilities for predictive alerting
- Extend the analytics system with trend detection
- Implement distributed tracing visualization
- Create user-configurable dashboards for log insights
- Add integration with external monitoring systems
