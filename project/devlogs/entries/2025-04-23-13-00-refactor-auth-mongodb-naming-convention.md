# [Refactor] Auth MongoDB Naming Convention Standardization

**Date:** 2025-04-23 13:00
**Author:** Development Team

## Changes Made
- Updated variable naming in `auth-mongodb.ts` to consistently use `authMongodb` prefix
- Renamed global connection variables to use `_authMongodbClientPromise`
- Updated function names to follow consistent naming pattern:
  - `getAuthMongodbDb` instead of `getAuthDb`
  - `verifyAuthMongodbConnection` instead of `verifyAuthConnection`
- Updated imports in related files to reference the new function names
- Added clearer documentation on the purpose of the auth MongoDB client

## Decisions
- **Decision:** Standardize naming convention for AuthJS MongoDB connection

**Rationale:**
- Clearer separation between auth-specific MongoDB connections and application MongoDB connections
- Reduces risk of accidentally using the wrong MongoDB client
- More explicit naming makes code more self-documenting
- Consistent naming pattern improves code searchability
- Aligns with best practices for component naming

## Challenges
- Ensuring all references to the old function names are updated
- Maintaining backward compatibility during transition period
- Balancing descriptive naming with code readability

## Next Steps
- Update any test files to use the new naming convention
- Gradually migrate existing code to use the explicit naming convention
- Add type safety mechanisms to prevent accidental client misuse
- Document the MongoDB client separation in the project documentation
