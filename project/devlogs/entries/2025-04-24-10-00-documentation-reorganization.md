## Summary

Reorganized project documentation to enhance modularity and reduce duplication. The consolidated `project-plan.md` file was distributed to appropriate files in the `project/docs/plan/` directory, and references to the now-deleted file were updated across documentation.

## Changes

1. **Content Distribution**: 
   - Distributed content from `project-plan.md` to the following files:
     - `project/docs/plan/project-plan-overview.md` (updated with implementation status, project structure)
     - `project/docs/plan/project-plan-milestones.md` (updated with milestone details)
     - `project/docs/plan/README.md` (added Documentation Integrity Guidelines)
     - Verified MCP Server and Logging Architecture sections in `project/docs/architecture/project-architecture-overview.md`

2. **Reference Updates**:
   - Updated `project/README.md` to point to individual plan files instead of the consolidated file
   - Updated `project/claude-desktop-project-instructions.md` to remove references to `project-plan.md`
   - Added clarification on documentation structure in Claude's instructions

3. **File Deletion**:
   - Removed `project/project-plan.md` after verifying all content was properly redistributed

## Rationale

This reorganization addresses several documentation challenges:

1. **Reduced Duplication**: Removed redundancy between the consolidated plan document and the detailed plan files
2. **Enhanced Modularity**: Ensured each plan file focuses on its specific aspect of the project
3. **Improved Maintenance**: Made documentation easier to maintain by having single sources of truth
4. **Preserved Content**: Maintained all content while reorganizing structure

## Implementation Notes

- Careful attention was paid to preserving all content, especially unimplemented features
- Documentation Integrity Guidelines were maintained and emphasized in the plan directory README
- Added a "Last Updated" date of 2025-04-23 to all modified files for consistency
- Verified all architecture documentation was complete and consistent

## Future Considerations

- Consider additional documentation structure improvements
- Review cross-referencing between documentation files
- Evaluate potential for automated documentation consistency checks
- Continue to emphasize the importance of documentation integrity
