## Metadata
- **Date**: 2025-04-20
- **Category**: feature
- **Status**: completed

## Overview
Implemented a comprehensive content editor with Markdown support for The Story Teller application. This editor provides a structured way for users to create and edit story content while maintaining integration with the schema-driven narrative elements. The implementation follows the specifications outlined in Phase 4 of the project plan.

## Implemented Features

### Markdown Editor Component
- Created a reusable `MarkdownEditor` component with real-time preview functionality
- Implemented a comprehensive toolbar with formatting options
- Added support for undo/redo operations and keyboard shortcuts
- Integrated syntax highlighting and preview rendering

### Content Structure Management
- Developed a `ContentEditor` component that supports:
  - Hierarchical content organization with chapters, scenes, notes, and descriptions
  - Drag-and-drop reordering of content sections
  - Section-specific metadata management
  - Narrative structure management

### Schema Integration
- Created a `SchemaIntegration` component that enables:
  - Browsing and searching for characters, locations, and events
  - Inserting entity references into the story content
  - Different display modes for entity references (mention, summary, detail)
  - Automatic linkage between story content and narrative databases

### Content Storage and Versioning
- Implemented API endpoints for:
  - Retrieving story content with proper schema validation
  - Saving content while maintaining version history
  - Accessing previous versions of content
  - Synchronizing content with story metadata

## Technical Details

### Component Architecture
The content editor implementation follows a modular architecture:
1. `MarkdownEditor` - Base component for text editing with Markdown support
2. `ContentEditor` - Manages content structure and section organization
3. `SchemaIntegration` - Connects narrative elements to the content
4. `StoryEditor` - High-level component that integrates all editor functionality

### Integration with Schema System
The editor maintains strict adherence to the schema-driven approach by:
- Validating all content against predefined schemas
- Ensuring proper relationships between narrative elements
- Providing structured templates for different content types
- Maintaining metadata integrity across the system

### API Design
The content API follows RESTful principles:
- `GET /api/stories/:storyId/content` - Retrieves story content
- `POST /api/stories/:storyId/content` - Saves content changes
- `GET /api/stories/:storyId/content?version=X` - Retrieves specific content version

### User Experience Considerations
- Implemented real-time preview to show rendered content as users type
- Added error handling and recovery mechanisms
- Provided autosave functionality to prevent data loss
- Created intuitive navigation between content sections

## Next Steps
- Enhance the editor with collaboration features
- Implement export options for different formats (PDF, ePub, etc.)
- Add support for image uploads and media embedding
- Create additional visualization tools for narrative structure

## Related Tasks
- Integration with character and location management
- Timeline visualization enhancements
- AI assistance for content generation
