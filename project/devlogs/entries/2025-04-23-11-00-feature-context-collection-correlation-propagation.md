# [feature] Context Collection and Correlation Propagation Implementation

**Date:** 2025-04-23 11:00
**Author:** Development Team

## Changes Made
- Implemented comprehensive context collection middleware for centralizing request context
- Added correlation ID propagation utilities for consistent tracing across service boundaries
- Implemented sensitive data masking with configurable patterns and redaction
- Created middleware for collecting and propagating contextual information
- Added utilities for handling correlation IDs in fetch requests and MCP server communication
- Implemented correlation ID extraction from responses
- Created comprehensive test suites for all new components
- Updated logging module exports to include all new functionality
- Added support for custom context extractors in middleware
- Implemented performance timing in middleware

## Decisions
- Used thread-local storage (Map object) for storing context during request processing
- Applied correlation ID propagation via HTTP headers for cross-service communication
- Created specialized utilities for MCP server communication to ensure proper context propagation
- Used a flexible configuration model for sensitive data masking
- Implemented a middleware-based approach for context collection to centralize the logic
- Used a decorator pattern for method-level logging with context
- Maintained backward compatibility with existing logger implementation
- Applied automatic correlation ID generation when none exists
- Used configurable patterns for sensitive data identification
- Added specialized handling for URLs, emails, and IP addresses in sensitive data masking

## Challenges
- Ensuring proper context propagation across asynchronous boundaries
- Maintaining context across different components and services
- Balancing comprehensive logging with performance concerns
- Handling sensitive data in different formats (objects, strings, arrays)
- Propagating correlation IDs across service boundaries
- Identifying the right patterns for sensitive data detection
- Creating a flexible yet consistent API for context management
- Ensuring proper thread safety for context storage
- Handling different header formats in fetch requests
- Integrating with existing logging implementation

## Next Steps
- Extend correlation ID propagation to client-side requests
- Create visualization dashboards for tracking request flows
- Implement log-based alerting for error patterns
- Add log retention and rotation policies
- Create log export functionality for offline analysis
- Enhance analytics capabilities with correlation-based insights
- Add automated log analysis for performance bottlenecks
- Implement distributed tracing visualization
- Create real-time monitoring dashboard for service health
- Add log volume analysis and optimization
