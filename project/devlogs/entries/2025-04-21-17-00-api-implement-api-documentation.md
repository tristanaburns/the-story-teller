**Date:** 2025-04-21 17:00
**Author:** Development Team

## Changes Made
- Created comprehensive OpenAPI specification for The Story Teller API
- Implemented `/api/docs` endpoint to serve the OpenAPI specification
- Created API documentation UI with SwaggerUI at `/api/docs/ui`
- Added tabs for Swagger UI, API overview, and authentication information
- Implemented session-based security for API documentation access
- Added detailed schema definitions for all API resources
- Documented all core API endpoints including:
  - Story management endpoints
  - Character management endpoints
  - Settings management endpoints
  - AI integration endpoints
  - MCP server integration endpoints
- Added detailed response and request schemas
- Implemented proper error handling for API documentation

## Decisions
- Used OpenAPI 3.1.0 specification for comprehensive documentation
- Implemented Swagger UI for interactive API exploration
- Added authentication to API docs in production mode for security
- Created a tabbed interface for different documentation aspects
- Used dynamic importing for Swagger UI to avoid SSR issues
- Added detailed schema definitions to ensure proper validation
- Documented authentication methods and protocols
- Included comprehensive error response documentation

## Challenges
- Creating a complete and accurate schema for all API endpoints
- Ensuring documentation is secure and only accessible to authenticated users
- Handling SSR issues with Swagger UI integration
- Balancing detail with maintainability in API documentation
- Ensuring documentation stays in sync with actual API implementation
- Documenting complex relationships between API resources

## Next Steps
- Implement automated OpenAPI specification generation from code
- Add code examples for common API operations
- Create API client libraries for common programming languages
- Implement API version control and deprecation notices
- Add API usage metrics and monitoring
- Create developer portal with more comprehensive documentation
- Add integration with Postman and other API tools
