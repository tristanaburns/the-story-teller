# [fix] NestJS TypeScript Configuration

**Date:** 2025-04-23 10:00
**Author:** Claude

## Changes Made
- Fixed TypeScript configuration issues in the Memory MCP NestJS server that were preventing successful builds
- Identified implicit React type dependencies despite the server not using React directly
- Added missing dependencies in package.json:
  - Added `@types/react` to devDependencies to resolve TypeScript errors
  - Added `@nestjs/passport`, `passport`, and `passport-http-bearer` to dependencies
- Updated tsconfig.json:
  - Added explicit `"types": ["node", "jest"]` to compilerOptions
  - Configured TypeScript to properly recognize test files and Node.js environment
- Successfully built the Memory MCP server after resolving all dependency and type issues

## Decisions
- **Decision:** Add React type definitions despite not using React directly
  **Rationale:** Some dependency in the project was implicitly referencing React types, and adding the type definitions was simpler than trying to identify and remove the reference

- **Decision:** Explicitly specify types array in tsconfig.json instead of relying on auto-detection
  **Rationale:** Prevents ambiguity in type resolution and clearly defines the project as a Node.js/NestJS application

- **Decision:** Include Jest types in the tsconfig.json types array
  **Rationale:** Ensures test files properly recognize Jest functions and types without type errors

## Challenges
- TypeScript was reporting "Cannot find type definition file for 'react'" despite this being a NestJS server project with no direct React dependencies
- The build system couldn't find several imported dependencies that weren't explicitly included in package.json
- Jest test files were showing TypeScript errors for standard testing functions like `describe`, `it`, and `expect`
- Finding the right combination of type definitions to include without introducing new problems

## Next Steps
- Apply similar configuration fixes to the other MCP servers (Everart, Sequential Thinking, MongoDB Atlas)
- Run tests to ensure the Memory MCP server works correctly with these configuration changes
- Consider adding more detailed documentation about the dependency requirements for the MCP servers
- Implement the comprehensive debug-level logging system for all MCP servers
