**Date:** 2025-04-21 20:00
**Author:** Development Team

## Changes Made
- Updated project-plan.md to mandate 100% test coverage for all code with no exceptions
- Updated project-requirements.md to include detailed test coverage requirements
- Added new "Test Coverage Mandates" section to project requirements
- Modified testing philosophy to emphasize absolute test coverage requirement
- Updated all testing sections to indicate 100% coverage requirement
- Added new guiding principle "Complete Test Coverage" for the project
- Added coverage enforcement mechanisms to testing tools section
- Extended testing milestone to include 100% test coverage across all components
- Updated maintainability requirements to reflect 100% coverage mandate

## Decisions
- Implemented strict 100% test coverage policy with absolutely no exceptions
- Decided to enforce test coverage at the CI/CD pipeline level
- Established that all edge cases and error paths must be explicitly tested
- Required comprehensive test documentation for all test cases
- Made test coverage verification a mandatory part of code reviews
- Mandated coverage for all metrics: statements, branches, functions, and lines
- Implemented automated test coverage reporting in the development workflow

## Challenges
- Ensuring existing codebase complies with 100% coverage requirement
- Creating comprehensive tests for complex UI components
- Properly mocking all external dependencies for testing
- Testing asynchronous operations and complex state management
- Maintaining test quality beyond just coverage metrics
- Ensuring edge cases are thoroughly tested
- Balancing testing effort with development velocity
- Implementing coverage tools across all components of the system

## Next Steps
- Update CI/CD pipeline to enforce 100% coverage requirement
- Create coverage reporting dashboards for the development team
- Update testing documentation with examples of proper test coverage
- Implement code review checklist for test coverage verification
- Train development team on writing comprehensive tests
- Audit existing code for test coverage gaps
- Implement 100% coverage for all existing and new MCP servers
- Enhance test coverage for UI components and complex logic
