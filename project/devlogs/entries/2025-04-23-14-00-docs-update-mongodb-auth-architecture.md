# [Docs] Update MongoDB Authentication Architecture Documentation

**Date:** 2025-04-23 14:00
**Author:** Development Team

## Changes Made
- Updated `project-structure.md` to reflect the new auth-mongodb client architecture
- Updated `project-structure.md` Authentication Flow section to document the separation of auth data
- Added new "MongoDB Client Architecture" section to `README.md` explaining the dual-client approach
- Ensured consistent naming convention (authMongodb prefix) is documented in all relevant files
- Added explanations about the purpose and benefits of the separation

## Decisions
- **Decision:** Document MongoDB client separation in project documentation

**Rationale:**
- Ensures developers understand the architecture design decisions
- Promotes consistent usage of the correct MongoDB client for each purpose
- Provides context for the naming conventions used in the codebase
- Creates a reference for onboarding new team members
- Establishes a pattern for similar architectural decisions in the future

## Challenges
- Ensuring documentation stays in sync with implementation as the codebase evolves
- Balancing technical detail with readability for different audiences
- Maintaining consistent terminology across different documentation files

## Next Steps
- Update any additional documentation files that may reference MongoDB or authentication
- Create more detailed architectural diagrams illustrating the dual-client approach
- Add code samples in documentation showing proper client usage patterns
- Consider creating a developer guide specifically for authentication implementation
- Update test documentation to include testing strategies for authentication
