# [Implementation] Memory MCP Server Integration

**Date:** 2025-04-20 16:00
**Author:** Project Team

## Changes Made
- Created basic MCP server directory structure
- Implemented TypeScript interfaces for MCP communication in `types/mcp.ts`
- Created MCP client utilities in `lib/mcp/` directory:
  - Main MCP client in `lib/mcp/index.ts`
  - Memory MCP client in `lib/mcp/memory.ts`
  - Art MCP client in `lib/mcp/art.ts`
  - Thinking MCP client in `lib/mcp/thinking.ts`
  - Database MCP client in `lib/mcp/database.ts`
- Implemented Memory MCP server in Express.js
  - Added server code in `mcp-servers/memory/index.js`
  - Created `package.json` and `.env.example`
  - Implemented memory storage, retrieval, and consolidation
- Created API routes for MCP communication:
  - Main MCP API route in `app/api/mcp/route.ts`
  - Memory MCP API route in `app/api/mcp/memory/route.ts`
- Added UI components for MCP server management:
  - `MCPServerStatus` component for monitoring server status
  - `MCPServerConfig` component for configuring server settings
  - MCP management page at `/dashboard/mcp`

## Decisions
- **Decision:** Use Express.js for MCP server implementation.
  **Rationale:** Express is lightweight, easy to extend, and has a large ecosystem of middleware.

- **Decision:** Store memory data in MongoDB.
  **Rationale:** MongoDB provides flexible schema, indexing for search, and scales well for narrative data.

- **Decision:** Create separate API routes for each MCP server type.
  **Rationale:** Enhances code organization and allows independent development of each MCP server type.

- **Decision:** Implement memory functions in both frontend and backend.
  **Rationale:** For development and testing purposes, having both implementations allows testing without requiring all components to be running.

- **Decision:** Use TypeScript interfaces for MCP communication.
  **Rationale:** Provides type safety and clear contract between client and server.

## Challenges
- **Challenge:** Maintaining consistent communication protocol across different MCP servers.
  **Solution:** Created shared TypeScript interfaces for request/response structure and standardized error handling.

- **Challenge:** Efficient memory storage and retrieval.
  **Solution:** Implemented indexing for common query fields and paginated search results.

- **Challenge:** Authentication and authorization for MCP servers.
  **Solution:** Implemented API key-based authentication with environment variable configuration.

- **Challenge:** Error handling and retry logic.
  **Solution:** Added standardized error response format and configurable retry settings in MCP client.

## Next Steps
1. Complete integration tests for Memory MCP
2. Implement UI components for memory management
3. Develop more sophisticated memory ranking algorithm
4. Implement remaining MCP servers (Everart, Sequential Thinking, MongoDB Atlas)
5. Create comprehensive MCP orchestration layer
6. Add monitoring and logging infrastructure for MCP servers
