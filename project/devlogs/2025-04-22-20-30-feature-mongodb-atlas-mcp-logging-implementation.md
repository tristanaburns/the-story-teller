# [feature] MongoDB Atlas MCP Server Logging Implementation

**Date:** 2025-04-22 20:30
**Author:** Development Team

## Changes Made
- Implemented comprehensive debug-level logging system for MongoDB Atlas MCP server
- Added MCPLoggerService integration to all components:
  - Updated app.module.ts to import and configure MCPLoggerModule
  - Modified main.ts to use MCPLoggerService as the application logger
  - Applied LogClass and LogMethod decorators to controller, service, and repositories
  - Added context tracking and correlation ID propagation
- Added detailed logging for MongoDB operations with appropriate context
- Updated .env.example with logging configuration options
- Applied LogMethod decorators with appropriate log levels across all methods
- Added trace-level logging for utility methods
- Implemented error logging with stack traces and detailed context
- Enhanced database operation and schema validation logging
- Updated error handling to include more detailed logging context

## Decisions
- Used shared logging module from `mcp-servers/shared/logging` to ensure consistent logging approach
- Applied class-level LogClass decorators to minimize repetitive code
- Improved error handling with separate error stack and context parameters
- Implemented different log levels based on method importance:
  - trace: Utility methods like ID generation
  - debug: Standard repository and service operations
  - info: Important service status changes
  - warn/error: Exceptional conditions
- Added structured context information to all log messages
- Used debug level for database operation details to enable troubleshooting
- Tracked database operation execution times for performance monitoring
- Ensured all MongoDB operations include correlation IDs for traceability

## Challenges
- Maintaining consistent logging patterns across different repositories
- Ensuring proper context is available in async operations
- Managing appropriate log levels for different operation types
- Implementing effective error logging without excessive verbosity
- Capturing the right context information for database operations
- Coordinating repository and service logging to avoid duplication
- Ensuring proper correlation ID propagation across all components

## Next Steps
- Create log dashboards specific to MongoDB Atlas operations
- Implement log-based analytics for database performance monitoring
- Create alerts for slow database operations
- Set up log retention and rotation policies
- Add performance benchmarking via logs
- Implement comprehensive tests for the logging system
- Add log visualization for database operations
- Consider extending with query execution plan logging
