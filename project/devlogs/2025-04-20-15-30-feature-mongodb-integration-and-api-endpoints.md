# MongoDB Integration and Core API Endpoints

**Date:** 2025-04-20  
**Category:** feature  
**Author:** Developer  

## Summary

Implemented MongoDB Atlas integration with user-specific database provisioning and core API endpoints for the story, character, location, and timeline functionality. This development completes a significant portion of the Core Infrastructure phase of the project plan.

## Details

### MongoDB Integration

- Set up MongoDB connection utilities with proper development/production handling
- Implemented user-specific database provisioning that creates separate collections for each user
- Added schema validation for MongoDB collections to ensure data integrity
- Created helper functions for database operations and entity management

### API Endpoints Implementation

Implemented the following API endpoints with full CRUD functionality:

1. **Stories API**
   - GET /api/stories - List all stories
   - GET /api/stories/:id - Get a single story
   - POST /api/stories - Create a new story
   - PUT /api/stories/:id - Update a story
   - DELETE /api/stories/:id - Delete a story

2. **Characters API**
   - GET /api/stories/:storyId/characters - List all characters
   - GET /api/stories/:storyId/characters/:id - Get a single character
   - POST /api/stories/:storyId/characters - Create a new character
   - PUT /api/stories/:storyId/characters/:id - Update a character
   - DELETE /api/stories/:storyId/characters/:id - Delete a character

3. **Locations API**
   - GET /api/stories/:storyId/locations - List all locations
   - GET /api/stories/:storyId/locations/:id - Get a single location
   - POST /api/stories/:storyId/locations - Create a new location
   - PUT /api/stories/:storyId/locations/:id - Update a location
   - DELETE /api/stories/:storyId/locations/:id - Delete a location

4. **Timeline API**
   - GET /api/stories/:storyId/timeline - Get all timeline events
   - GET /api/stories/:storyId/timeline/:id - Get a single timeline event
   - POST /api/stories/:storyId/timeline - Create a new timeline event
   - PUT /api/stories/:storyId/timeline/:id - Update a timeline event
   - DELETE /api/stories/:storyId/timeline/:id - Delete a timeline event

### Schema and Type Definitions

- Created MongoDB schema validators for all collections
- Defined TypeScript interfaces for all data models to ensure type safety
- Implemented proper error handling and validation across all endpoints

### Authentication Integration

- Ensured all API endpoints validate user authentication
- Implemented user-specific database access with proper isolation
- Added session user ID to all database operations for security

## Challenges and Solutions

**Challenge**: Implementing schema validation for MongoDB collections while maintaining flexibility for future schema evolution.

**Solution**: Created schema validators with `validationLevel: 'moderate'` to allow for schema evolution while still enforcing core data integrity rules. Used TypeScript interfaces to provide additional type safety during development.

**Challenge**: Ensuring proper reference integrity between related entities (characters, locations, events).

**Solution**: Implemented cleanup operations during delete operations to maintain reference integrity. For example, when deleting a character, we also remove references to that character from relationships and timeline events.

## Next Steps

1. Implement the planned dashboard UI components to interact with these APIs
2. Create the story creation and editing interfaces
3. Develop character and location management UI components
4. Begin implementation of the timeline visualization component
5. Setup AI integration API endpoints for content generation assistance
