# [feature] MongoDB Atlas MCP Server Implementation

**Date:** 2025-04-21 10:00
**Author:** Development Team

## Changes Made
- Created initial structure for MongoDB Atlas MCP server using NestJS
- Implemented core MongoDB Atlas MCP server components:
  - Basic configuration files (package.json, Dockerfile, docker-compose.yml, .env.example)
  - NestJS application structure (main.ts, app.module.ts)
  - MongoDB schemas (database-operation.schema.ts, schema-definition.schema.ts)
  - DTOs for request/response validation
  - Repository implementation for database operations and schema definitions
  - Controller with endpoints for all MCP operations
  - Service implementation with simulated MongoDB Atlas operations
  - Authentication with API key validation
  - Exception handling with standardized MCP error responses
  - Comprehensive logging with detailed context information
- Added all required API endpoints for MCP operations:
  - query: Flexible MongoDB queries with filtering, sorting, and pagination
  - create: Document creation with schema validation
  - update: Document updates with multi-document support
  - delete: Document deletion with filtering options
  - schema: Schema management for MongoDB collections
  - search: Text search across collections
  - execute: MongoDB aggregation pipeline execution
- Implemented detailed logging for all database operations with:
  - Request/response details
  - Execution time metrics
  - Success/failure status
  - Error handling with stack traces
  - User and request context information

## Decisions
- Used NestJS as the framework for consistency with other MCP servers
- Implemented MongoDB schema for storing operation logs to provide comprehensive audit history
- Created schema definition management to support schema-driven development approach
- Simulated actual MongoDB Atlas API operations for initial implementation
- Added detailed logging for all operations to support the centralized logging system
- Used repository pattern to separate data access from business logic
- Created standardized MCP request/response formats with Swagger documentation
- Implemented API key authentication for securing the MCP server
- Used Docker for containerization to ensure consistent deployment

## Challenges
- Balancing between immediate functionality and future extensibility in the API design
- Ensuring comprehensive logging without impacting performance
- Designing a flexible schema validation system that works with MongoDB's document model
- Creating a consistent error handling approach that follows MCP protocol standards
- Simulating MongoDB Atlas API operations while maintaining realistic behavior

## Next Steps
- Complete integration with actual MongoDB Atlas API
- Implement real schema validation using JSON Schema
- Add integration tests for all API endpoints
- Set up CI/CD pipeline for automated testing and deployment
- Integrate with the centralized logging system
- Implement advanced MongoDB Atlas features like search indexes and data API
- Create user-specific database provisioning
- Add support for MongoDB Atlas Charts integration
