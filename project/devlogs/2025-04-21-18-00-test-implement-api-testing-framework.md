# [test] Implement API Testing Framework

**Date:** 2025-04-21 18:00
**Author:** Development Team

## Changes Made
- Created Jest configuration with TypeScript support (`jest.config.js`)
- Created Jest TypeScript configuration (`tsconfig.jest.json`)
- Added test setup file with common mocks for NextAuth, MongoDB, and logging
- Created API testing helpers to simplify API endpoint testing
- Implemented mock utilities for NextRequest, database responses, etc.
- Created comprehensive test cases for settings API endpoints (GET/PUT)
- Implemented test cases for stories API endpoints (GET/POST)
- Configured test coverage thresholds (70% for lines, functions, branches)
- Added specialized mock factories for test data generation
- Implemented test utilities for authenticated/unauthenticated routes

## Decisions
- Used Jest with ts-jest for TypeScript support
- Created a testApiRoute utility for testing API route handlers directly
- Implemented extensive mocking for NextAuth and MongoDB to avoid external dependencies
- Structured tests for multiple API endpoints to establish patterns for future tests
- Used beforeEach hooks to reset mocks between tests
- Tested both success and error paths for all API endpoints
- Implemented negative tests for authentication failures
- Created helper functions to generate test data consistently

## Challenges
- Creating proper mocks for NextAuth session handling
- Simulating MongoDB behavior without starting a real database
- Testing API routes with complex dependencies
- Managing state between tests to ensure isolation
- Creating realistic test data that matches schema requirements
- Mocking complex Next.js request/response objects
- Ensuring tests cover both successful operations and error cases

## Next Steps
- Add tests for all remaining API endpoints
- Add test cases for MCP server integration
- Implement E2E tests with Playwright
- Create database integration tests with mongodb-memory-server
- Set up GitHub Actions workflow for running tests on PR and commit
- Set up test coverage reporting
- Add performance tests for critical API endpoints
- Create documentation for testing patterns and best practices
