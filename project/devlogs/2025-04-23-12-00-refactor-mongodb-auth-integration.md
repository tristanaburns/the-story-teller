# [Refactor] MongoDB and Auth Integration Restructuring

**Date:** 2025-04-23 12:00
**Author:** Development Team

## Changes Made
- Created dedicated MongoDB client specifically for AuthJS in `lib/auth-mongodb.ts`
- Established proper separation between auth database operations and main app database operations
- Created new directory structure in `lib/auth/` for better organization of authentication code
- Implemented proper module structure with index.ts, options.ts, and session.ts
- Added backward compatibility with deprecation warnings in the original `lib/auth.ts`
- Ensured root `auth.ts` uses the dedicated auth MongoDB client
- Updated MongoDB import in user-db.ts to use the proper client

## Decisions
- **Decision:** Separate MongoDB clients for AuthJS and main application

**Rationale:**
- Prevents interference between authentication operations and application data operations
- Creates clearer separation of concerns for database access
- Allows independent scaling and optimization of auth vs. application databases
- Makes it easier to migrate or change auth providers in the future
- Improves security by isolating authentication data access
- Follows best practices for Next.js AuthJS integration

## Challenges
- Maintaining backward compatibility with existing code that imports from original locations
- Ensuring consistent connection handling between the two MongoDB clients
- Managing proper error handling and logging for both database connections
- Avoiding duplicate database connections in development environment
- Ensuring same MongoDB URI is used for both clients to maintain data consistency

## Next Steps
- Migrate all imports to use the new auth directory structure
- Add testing for the new auth MongoDB client
- Create a cron job to clean up expired sessions from the auth database
- Improve error handling and retry logic for auth database operations
- Consider adding monitoring for auth database performance
- Update documentation to reflect the new architecture
