 # DEVLOG Instructions

## Purpose

The Development Log system is designed to create a chronological record of all significant changes, decisions, challenges, and milestones throughout the project lifecycle. This documentation serves multiple purposes:

1. **Historical Record**: Maintains a complete history of the project's evolution
2. **Knowledge Transfer**: Helps new team members understand project decisions
3. **Issue Tracking**: Documents challenges and their solutions
4. **Progress Tracking**: Records milestone achievements and progress
5. **Decision Documentation**: Preserves the rationale behind technical choices

## Structure & Organization

### Individual DEVLOG Files

All development logs are stored as individual files in the `/project/devlogs/` directory:

1. **File Naming Convention**: `YYYY-MM-DD-HH-MM-category-brief-title.md`
   - Example: `2025-04-20-14-30-enhancement-add-mcp-integration.md`

2. **Categories** (included in filename):
   - `feature` - New feature implementation
   - `fix` - Bug fix or issue resolution
   - `refactor` - Code restructuring without behavior change
   - `docs` - Documentation updates
   - `test` - Test addition or modification
   - `perf` - Performance improvement
   - `devops` - CI/CD, deployment, build processes
   - `security` - Security-related changes
   - `database` - Database schema or query changes
   - `ui` - User interface changes
   - `api` - API-related changes
   - `dependency` - External dependency updates

3. **Never Delete Logs**: Old logs should NEVER be deleted or modified once committed

### Entry Format

Each DEVLOG file should follow this consistent format:

```markdown
# [Category] Brief Title

**Date:** YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM
**Author:** Your Name

## Changes Made
- Detailed list of changes
- Be specific about files, features, or components
- Include links to relevant PRs or issues

## Decisions
- Document important decisions made
- Include rationale behind choices
- Reference any alternatives considered

## Challenges
- Document any significant challenges encountered
- Describe solutions implemented or proposed
- Note any unresolved issues

## Next Steps
- List planned next actions
- Include any dependencies or blockers
- Reference related future work
```

## Best Practices

1. **Be Prompt**: Create DEVLOG entries as soon as significant changes are made
2. **Be Thorough**: Include all relevant details
3. **Be Clear**: Use simple, direct language
4. **Be Factual**: Focus on what happened, not opinions
5. **Link Related Entries**: Reference previous entries where relevant
6. **Include Resources**: Add links to external resources or references when applicable
7. **Capture Context**: Include enough context to understand the entry without requiring other knowledge
8. **One Entry Per Change**: Create separate entries for distinct changes, even if made at the same time

## Creating a New DEVLOG Entry

### Command Line (PowerShell)

```powershell
# Run from project root
$timestamp = Get-Date -Format "yyyy-MM-dd-HH-mm"
$category = "feature"  # Replace with appropriate category
$title = "brief-descriptive-title"  # Replace with your title
$filename = "$timestamp-$category-$title.md"
$path = "project/devlogs/$filename"

# Create file with template
@"
# [$category] $(($title -replace '-', ' ') -replace '\b(\w)', { $_.Groups[1].Value.ToUpper() })

**Date:** $(Get-Date -Format "yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm")
**Author:** Your Name

## Changes Made
- 

## Decisions
- 

## Challenges
- 

## Next Steps
- 
"@ | Out-File -FilePath $path -Encoding utf8

Write-Host "Created new DEVLOG entry: $path"
```

### Command Line (Bash)

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Run from project root
timestamp=$(date +"%Y-%m-%d-%H-%M")
category="feature"  # Replace with appropriate category
title="brief-descriptive-title"  # Replace with your title
filename="${timestamp}-${category}-${title}.md"
path="project/devlogs/${filename}"

# Create file with template
cat > "$path" << EOF
# [${category}] $(echo "$title" | sed -e 's/-/ /g' -e 's/\b\(.\)/\u\1/g')

**Date:** $(date +"%Y-%m-%d %H:%M")
**Author:** Your Name

## Changes Made
- 

## Decisions
- 

## Challenges
- 

## Next Steps
- 
EOF

echo "Created new DEVLOG entry: $path"
```

## Index Generation

A summary index file (`DEVLOG_INDEX.md`) is automatically generated from all individual DEVLOG entries. Do not edit this file manually as it will be overwritten.

## Important Note on Version Control

While git commit history provides some project history, the DEVLOG system serves a different purpose:

- **Git**: Tracks code changes at a granular level
- **DEVLOG**: Captures high-level changes, decisions, and context

Both are important and complementary. Use meaningful git commit messages, but reserve detailed explanations and decision rationale for DEVLOG entries.

---

By following these guidelines, the DEVLOG system will become an invaluable resource for current and future team members to understand the project's evolution and the reasoning behind key decisions.
