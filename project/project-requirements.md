# The Story Teller: Project Requirements

## DOCUMENTATION MAINTENANCE REQUIREMENTS

**CRITICAL**: All project documentation must adhere to these mandatory requirements:

1. **Preservation of Requirements**: Requirements and specifications documented in this file must NEVER be deleted, even if implementation is delayed or in progress.
2. **Scope-Limited Updates**: Documentation updates must be limited to only the specific areas relevant to the change.
3. **No Removal of Planned Features**: Documentation for planned features must be preserved regardless of implementation status.
4. **Structure Preservation**: The existing structure, formatting, and organization of this document must be maintained.
5. **Change Documentation**: Any significant changes to requirements must be documented with rationale and approved before implementation.

These rules apply to all project documentation files, including requirements, plans, and technical specifications. Removing documented requirements, even if not yet implemented, violates project governance procedures.

## Summary

The Story Teller is an advanced schema-driven web application designed to create, manage, and visualize rich narrative content with AI assistance. It provides a structured approach to storytelling by implementing standardized schemas for narrative elements (characters, locations, events, timelines), comprehensive metadata tracking, and AI integration for content generation. The system aims to help storytellers maintain consistency, manage complex narratives, and streamline the creative process while ensuring high-quality output.
