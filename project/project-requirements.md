# The Story Teller: Project Requirements

## DOCUMENTATION MAINTENANCE REQUIREMENTS

**CRITICAL**: All project documentation must adhere to these mandatory requirements:

1. **Preservation of Requirements**: Requirements and specifications documented in this file must NEVER be deleted, even if implementation is delayed or in progress.
2. **Scope-Limited Updates**: Documentation updates must be limited to only the specific areas relevant to the change.
3. **No Removal of Planned Features**: Documentation for planned features must be preserved regardless of implementation status.
4. **Structure Preservation**: The existing structure, formatting, and organization of this document must be maintained.
5. **Change Documentation**: Any significant changes to requirements must be documented with rationale and approved before implementation.

These rules apply to all project documentation files, including requirements, plans, and technical specifications. Removing documented requirements, even if not yet implemented, violates project governance procedures.

## Project Overview

**Project Type:** Next.js Web Application with MongoDB Atlas Integration  
**Languages:** TypeScript, JavaScript  
**Database:** MongoDB Atlas  
**Deployment Target:** Vercel  
**MCP Server Technology:** NestJS

## Summary

The Story Teller is an advanced schema-driven web application designed to create, manage, and visualize rich narrative content with AI assistance. It provides a structured approach to storytelling by implementing standardized schemas for narrative elements (characters, locations, events, timelines), comprehensive metadata tracking, and AI integration for content generation. The system aims to help storytellers maintain consistency, manage complex narratives, and streamline the creative process while ensuring high-quality output.

## Sequential Thinking MCP Server

The Sequential Thinking MCP Server is a specialized NestJS-based service that enables structured, step-by-step reasoning processes for story development and analysis. It provides API endpoints for creating, managing, and querying thinking processes with multi-step operations.

### Core Features

- **Structured Thinking Processes**: Create and manage multi-step thinking processes with defined inputs, outputs, and intermediate steps.
- **Asynchronous Processing**: Background execution of potentially long-running thinking tasks without blocking API responses.
- **Step-by-Step Reasoning**: Breaking down complex problems into manageable steps with clear progression.
- **Process Tracking**: Comprehensive status and progress tracking throughout the thinking lifecycle.
- **API Authentication**: Secure API key-based authentication for all endpoints.
- **Process Search**: Searchable by user, story, type, and status.

### Schema Design

The ThinkingProcess schema includes:
- Unique process identifier
- User and story association
- Process type (story-analysis, character-development, etc.)
- Status tracking (pending, in-progress, completed, failed)
- Progress percentage
- Input data for the process
- Output results from the process
- Error details if applicable
- Timestamps for creation, start, and completion
- Array of steps with individual status tracking

### API Endpoints

- `POST /thinking`: Create a new thinking process
- `GET /thinking/:processId`: Get a specific thinking process by ID
- `GET /thinking/user/:userId`: Get thinking processes by user ID
- `GET /thinking/story/:storyId`: Get thinking processes by story ID
- `PUT /thinking/:processId`: Update a thinking process
- `DELETE /thinking/:processId`: Delete a thinking process

### Integration Points

The Sequential Thinking MCP Server integrates with:
- MongoDB for data persistence
- Core application for user and story context
- Logging infrastructure for operational monitoring
- MCP orchestration for cross-server communication

### Implementation Details

- NestJS framework with TypeScript
- MongoDB with Mongoose ODM
- Repository pattern for database access
- DTOs for request/response validation
- Swagger UI for API documentation
- Modular architecture with separation of concerns
- Comprehensive error handling
- Environment-based configuration
