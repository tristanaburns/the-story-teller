# The Story Teller: Implementation Plan

*Last Updated: 2025-04-23*

## Documentation Integrity Guidelines

**MANDATORY**: This document is subject to strict documentation integrity requirements:

1. **Never Delete Unimplemented Items**: Plan items that have not yet been implemented must NEVER be deleted from this document.
2. **Limited-Scope Updates**: Only update sections directly related to your specific changes.
3. **Preserve Project Roadmap**: The full project roadmap must be maintained regardless of implementation status.
4. **Maintain Historical Context**: Previous planning decisions must be preserved for reference and continuity.
5. **Incremental Updates Only**: Add new information incrementally rather than replacing existing content.

These requirements ensure that the project plan remains a comprehensive roadmap and historical record. Removing planned but unimplemented features from documentation is strictly prohibited as it compromises project integrity.

## Project Overview

**Project Name:** The Story Teller  
**Architecture:** Next.js application with MongoDB Atlas, NestJS MCP servers, and AI integration  
**Primary Technology:** TypeScript, Next.js, NestJS, MongoDB, Model Context Protocol  
**Secondary Technology:** OpenAI API, D3.js, Tailwind CSS  

The Story Teller is an advanced schema-driven framework designed to create rich, consistent narrative content with AI assistance. It combines structured metadata, standardized writing patterns, comprehensive documentation, and specialized NestJS-based Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers to enable the creation of complex, interconnected stories while maintaining continuity and quality.

## Guiding Principles

1. **Schema-Driven Development**: Create and maintain formal schemas for all narrative elements
2. **Data Integrity**: Ensure relationships between narrative elements are maintained
3. **User Experience First**: Design intuitive interfaces for complex operations
4. **AI Augmentation**: Use AI to assist creativity, not replace it
5. **Consistent Documentation**: Maintain comprehensive documentation at all levels
6. **Modular Architecture**: Create loosely coupled components for future extensibility
7. **Performance Optimization**: Ensure responsive experience even with large datasets
8. **MCP Integration**: Leverage specialized NestJS-based MCP servers for enhanced functionality
9. **Observability**: Maintain comprehensive logging across all components for debugging, monitoring, and analysis
10. **Complete Test Coverage**: Maintain 100% test coverage across all code with no exceptions

## Testing Philosophy

Each module, feature, and component will undergo thorough testing before moving to the next implementation phase. Our testing approach includes:

1. **Unit Testing**: Testing individual functions and API endpoints (100% code coverage required)
2. **Integration Testing**: Testing interactions between components, especially AI integration (100% code coverage required)
3. **End-to-End Testing**: Testing complete user workflows for story creation and management (100% code coverage required)
4. **Performance Testing**: Testing application responsiveness with large narrative databases
5. **Security Testing**: Validating authentication, authorization, and data security
6. **Cross-Browser Testing**: Ensuring compatibility across major browsers
7. **MCP Server Testing**: Validating NestJS MCP server functionality and integration (100% code coverage required)
8. **Logging Testing**: Verifying correct functionality of the logging system across all components (100% code coverage required)

There will be absolutely no exceptions to the 100% test coverage requirement. All code must be fully tested before being considered complete. This strict testing policy ensures maximum system stability, prevents cascading issues, and maintains the highest quality standards. Only after a component passes its complete test suite will we proceed to the next implementation phase.

   - Log level hierarchy (TRACE, DEBUG, INFO, WARN, ERROR, FATAL)
   - Automatic sensitive data redaction

2. **Context Propagation**:
   - Correlation ID tracking across components
   - Request ID association for web requests
   - User ID inclusion for authenticated operations
   - Component and method identification
   - Performance metrics with duration tracking

3. **Specialized Loggers**:
   - Database operation logging (MongoDB)
   - API request/response logging
   - MCP server communication logging
   - AI integration logging
   - Client-side error and event logging

4. **Log Management**:
   - Log querying and search functionality
   - Log visualization dashboard
   - Log level configuration management
   - Log-based alerting system
   - Performance impact optimization

## MCP Server Architecture

The application integrates with four specialized NestJS-based MCP servers, each providing distinct capabilities:

1. **Memory MCP Server**: 
   - Handles memory storage and retrieval

2. **Everart MCP Server**: 
   - Manages character and location visualization
   - Supports artwork generation and storage
   - Implements style consistency management
   - Handles artwork metadata tagging
   - Provides search functionality for visual assets

3. **Sequential Thinking MCP Server**: 
   - Provides step-by-step reasoning capabilities
   - Supports structured thinking processes
   - Enables process creation and management
   - Implements reasoning step addition
   - Handles process completion with conclusions

4. **MongoDB Atlas MCP Server**: 
   - Offers schema-aware database operations
   - Supports complex query construction
   - Provides schema management and validation
