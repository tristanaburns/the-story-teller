# The Story Teller: Implementation Plan

## Documentation Integrity Guidelines

**MANDATORY**: This document is subject to strict documentation integrity requirements:

1. **Never Delete Unimplemented Items**: Plan items that have not yet been implemented must NEVER be deleted from this document.
2. **Limited-Scope Updates**: Only update sections directly related to your specific changes.
3. **Preserve Project Roadmap**: The full project roadmap must be maintained regardless of implementation status.
4. **Maintain Historical Context**: Previous planning decisions must be preserved for reference and continuity.
5. **Incremental Updates Only**: Add new information incrementally rather than replacing existing content.

These requirements ensure that the project plan remains a comprehensive roadmap and historical record. Removing planned but unimplemented features from documentation is strictly prohibited as it compromises project integrity.

## Project Overview

**Project Name:** The Story Teller  
**Architecture:** Next.js application with MongoDB Atlas and AI integration  
**Primary Technology:** TypeScript, Next.js, MongoDB  
**Secondary Technology:** OpenAI API, D3.js, Tailwind CSS  

The Story Teller is an advanced schema-driven framework designed to create rich, consistent narrative content with AI assistance. It combines structured metadata, standardized writing patterns, and comprehensive documentation to enable the creation of complex, interconnected stories while maintaining continuity and quality.

## Guiding Principles

1. **Schema-Driven Development**: Create and maintain formal schemas for all narrative elements
2. **Data Integrity**: Ensure relationships between narrative elements are maintained
3. **User Experience First**: Design intuitive interfaces for complex operations
4. **AI Augmentation**: Use AI to assist creativity, not replace it
5. **Consistent Documentation**: Maintain comprehensive documentation at all levels
6. **Modular Architecture**: Create loosely coupled components for future extensibility
7. **Performance Optimization**: Ensure responsive experience even with large datasets

---

## Testing Philosophy

Each module, feature, and component will undergo thorough testing before moving to the next implementation phase. Our testing approach includes:

1. **Unit Testing**: Testing individual functions and API endpoints (aiming for 80%+ coverage)
2. **Integration Testing**: Testing interactions between components, especially AI integration
3. **End-to-End Testing**: Testing complete user workflows for story creation and management
4. **Performance Testing**: Testing application responsiveness with large narrative databases
5. **Security Testing**: Validating authentication, authorization, and data security
6. **Cross-Browser Testing**: Ensuring compatibility across major browsers

Only after a component passes its test suite will we proceed to the next implementation phase. This ensures system stability and prevents cascading issues that might be more difficult to resolve later.

## Cross-Cutting Concerns

### Logging and Observability

All components must implement a standardized logging approach with the following characteristics:

1. **Centralized Logger Configuration**
   - Environment-based log levels (debug in development, info in production)
   - Structured JSON format for machine parsing
   - Consistent error formatting

2. **Mandatory Context Information**
   - User ID (when authenticated)
   - Request ID for correlation
   - Component/module identifier
   - Timestamp with millisecond precision

3. **API Request Logging**
   - HTTP method and path
   - Request parameters (sanitized)
   - Response status code
   - Execution time for performance monitoring

4. **Error Handling Integration**
   - Standardized error response format
   - Error classification and codes
   - Stack traces in development environment
   - User-friendly error messages in production

5. **Performance Monitoring**
   - Database query timing
   - API response timing
   - UI rendering performance
   - Resource utilization metrics

### Security Implementation

All components must adhere to these security standards:

1. **Authentication**
   - OAuth 2.0 with Google and GitHub providers
   - Secure session management
   - CSRF protection
   - Rate limiting for authentication attempts

2. **Authorization**
   - Role-based access control
   - Resource ownership validation
   - Database isolation between users
   - API access control

3. **Data Protection**
   - HTTPS for all communications
   - Input validation and sanitization
   - MongoDB injection protection
   - Sensitive data handling guidelines

4. **API Security**
   - API key management for AI integration
   - Request validation middleware
   - Response sanitization
   - Error handling that doesn't expose sensitive information

### API Documentation Standards

All APIs must be documented with:

1. **Comprehensive Endpoint Documentation**
   - Purpose and functionality
   - Request parameters and types
   - Response format and status codes
   - Example requests and responses

2. **Data Models and Schemas**
   - Complete schema definitions
   - Field descriptions and constraints
   - Relationships between models
   - Validation rules

3. **Authentication Requirements**
   - Required permissions
   - Authentication methods
   - Token usage and examples
   - Error scenarios

4. **Integration Examples**
   - Code samples for common operations
   - Integration patterns
   - Workflow examples
   - Error handling examples
